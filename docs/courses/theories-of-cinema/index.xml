      <description>Collaborative Film Zine # Read the Zine! # Women, Cinema, Nation film zine, shared with permission of the contributors.
Instructions # In the final weeks of the course, we will plan and create a collaborative zine that showcases your creative and analytical work on a topic we&amp;rsquo;ve examined. This zine will serve as a record of our semester, a celebration of our intellectual community, and a chance for you each to dive deeper into a theoretical concept or film that speaks to you.</description>
