this is the source branch for nonmodernist.com, built with zola and the apollo theme. it has an action set up so that updates here will trigger zola to build the site over at the main branch. workflow stuff to remember: i have to download this branch locally when i plan to make a bunch of updates, because the version that lives on my computer is probably not up to date. :)
