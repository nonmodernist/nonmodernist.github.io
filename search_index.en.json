Her research focuses on the intersections of literature, film, and other media in the early 20th century, with a special interest in the historical recovery of neglected women writers and filmmakers.\nHer first book, Before Fanfiction: Recovering the Literary History of American Media Fandom, was released by LSU Press in October 2023, and recently received an honorable mention for the biennial MLA Prize for Contingent Faculty and Independent Scholars.\nAlexandra’s current project, Hollywood Regionalism, investigates how the studio system adapted, revised, and transformed dozens of regional novels by American women writers from 1910-1961. She and her students have researched hundreds of these film adaptations, many lost or forgotten, and are working to bring them back into public view.\nIn 2024, Alexandra's photo essay \"A Walk Through Weelaunee Forest,\" was a finalist for an Atlanta Press Club Award. The essay explores the natural and political history of the forest slated to become \"Cop City\" in Dekalb County, Georgia.\nAlexandra previously co-hosted a podcast about college and coronavirus, wrote a poetry chapbook about Godzilla, and won two Primetime Emmys for her work as a transmedia producer creating interactive storytelling experiences.\n💡 About this site\nThis site is built with Zola and uses Apollo, with modifications by me. It lives on GitHub and is deployed with GitHub Pages. The super cute emojis were created by Monica Dinculescu and are based on the original Docomo emoji set from 2001, and the favicon is created by frelayasia. Images are dithered using Dither Me This, making their file sizes smaller. Patterns are generated using Doodad.dev's Pattern Generator. I got the pixel corners code for image borders from Luke Bonaccorsi.

Henri de Bourbon. Isabelle Adjani stars alongside Jean-Hugues Anglade and Vincent Perez. The film is based on the book by Alexandre Dumas, and while it isn't necessarily historically accurate, it is a delight and a terror. Margot's love affair with La Môle begins only days before the infamous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, and they find themselves endangered by both their love and their stations in life. Adjani is almost too beautiful to stand, as usual; Perez is too, this time around (unlike what I thought of him in Indochine). But truly, I enjoyed this film for its unarguably French style--Dumas was a master, I am now discovering.\nThe romantic and historical blend enticingly, and I'm fascinated by what happened in France after this. Henri de Bourbon became King of France when Margot's brother, Henri III, died. The line of Bourbon kings were pretty much adored by the French, ruling from 1589 until the French Revolution in 1792, and even again briefly afterwards. It was a tradition to cut out the heart of a Bourbon king upon his death, and place it in a special coffer. Not until Louis XV did this stop, and most likely only then because he ended his reign known as le Bien-Hai, the Well-Hated.\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2006-10-29-queen-margot-1994/","path":"/log/2006-10-29-queen-margot-1994/","title":"Queen Margot, 1994 - ★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2006-11-05-marie-antoinette-2006/":{"body":"I just got home from seeing this film, and of course I loved it. Of course, I would have a hard time not loving anything involving both Gang of Four and a big orgy of frothy period costumes.\nI don't want to say too much about it, as it feels unnecessary to overthink this one. But of course, Sofia Coppola has made her into all of us, and the minutae of her life feels very contemporary, very understandable to me which I think is somewhat of a generational thing.

Robert Mitchum is that man, here, a traveling preacher who murders widows for money and believes that God tells him to.\nThis film is in the noir tradition, though instead of presenting the foggy or rain-slicked urban streets of a city, it deals entirely with rural West Virginia and the Ohio River. Shots of various animals are interspersed (rather than shots of city lights and lonely diners)--the whole effect is kind of strange.\nThe story is strange too. I wonder if the original plot didn't suffer under the strict rules of the Production Code. We're presented with many dualities: love/hate, good/evil, male/female. The children at the center of the film are saved by a woman who raises orphans and teaches them Bible stories, but who unfortunately talks to herself in much the same way the preacher does. This convention, particularly at the very end, lends a creepiness that I don't think was intended.\nStill, I'm amazed that in 1955 a movie with such strong themes of female empowerment, female love and protection, and anti-religiosity was made at all. I love those bits, of course--how religion is really just an excuse for people to enact their bullshit personal politics all over you, and how children inevitably get caught in the middle. And how shit like that will kill you, because you really have to be a terrible person to manipulate people based on how fucked-up you are in the head and then have nerve to call that God.\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2007-08-30-the-night-of-the-hunter-1955/","path":"/log/2007-08-30-the-night-of-the-hunter-1955/","title":"The Night of the Hunter, 1955 - ★★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2007-08-31-to-have-and-have-not-1944/":{"body":"Bogey plays it somewhat differently than his hard-boiled detective (Spade or Marlowe)--here he's kind, caring, performs emergency surgery with confidence, and smiles a whole lot.\nBut who wouldn't smile at Lauren Bacall?

Is Kate meant to be Baldwin herself? The film practically winks at us.\nThis 59-minute programmer marks Joan Blondell's first talkie, though she's not the lead - that honor goes to Dorothy Mackaill as Anne, the secretary who becomes indispensable to her married boss in more ways than one. The film is pre-Code as hell, from Blondell's morning bath scene (where she casually discusses workplace sexual harassment as a job hazard) to the surprisingly mature conversation between Fellowes and his wife about their mutual infidelities.\nBaldwin's voice comes through in the women characters, who are not victims or vamps, but working professionals navigating a system where personal and professional boundaries barely exist. The wife character could have been a shrew, but she's given dignity. The secretaries aren't just typing machines but have inner lives and agency—even the dowdy one who has fallen in love with Fellowes and faints upon hearing, at the beginning of the film, that he is to be married.\nThe early sound limitations are obvious - no score, static camera work - but there's a snappy energy that keeps it engaging. That final parallel between two fainting secretaries—Anne swoons when she learns Fellowes is to be divorced—is a delicious bit of melodrama that Baldwin surely approved of.\n[Part of the Adapted from American Women research project, documenting Hollywood's adaptations of American women writers 1910-1960.

Vicki Baum, who left Germany for America in the 1930s, followed up the massive success of Grand Hotel, set during WWI, with an even more timely \"hotel novel,\" released in 1943 and adapted by Warners in early 1945.\nThe opening credits, printed in a book bearing Baum's name, announce this as serious literary adaptation. What follows is a morally murky portrait of Germans in the final days of the Reich—resistance fighters, opportunists, true believers, and those just trying to survive. For the first 15 minutes, you genuinely can't tell who you are supposed to root for.\nPeter Lorre chews delicious scenery as a scientist grappling with science's complicity in genocide, while Andrea King's Lisa embodies the desperate amorality of survival—promising herself to anyone who might get her out, playing resistance fighter when convenient, but ultimately loyal only to herself.\nBut it's Faye Emerson's Tillie (the hotel hostess) who provides the film's emotional core. Her air raid shelter breakdown—as she screams at a smarmy Alan Hale about his journey from petty local bully to petty local Nazi bully—and her climactic confession to the resistance—revealing how she became an informant after the Nazis reportedly killed her Jewish lover—are devastating. The parallel between her genuine shame and Lisa's calculated performance shows Baum's understanding of how fascism corrupts both willing and unwilling participants.\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-06-23-hotel-berlin-1945/","path":"/log/2025-06-23-hotel-berlin-1945/","title":"Hotel Berlin, 1945 - ★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-06-23-june-bride-1948/":{"body":"charming romantic comedy with hints of christmas in connecticut but fewer madcap antics\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-06-23-june-bride-1948/","path":"/log/2025-06-23-june-bride-1948/","title":"June Bride, 1948 - ★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-06-23-ramona-1910/":{"body":"an incredibly condensed version of helen hunt jackson's only novel, ramona. this was the first of 4 film versions of the novel, which jackson apparently hoped would do for indigenous rights what uncle tom's cabin did for emancipation. it's sloppy but fascinating—one wonders if griffith and co. knew about jackson's novel before visiting southern california.\n—————\n[Part of the Adapted from American Women research project, documenting Hollywood's adaptations of American women writers 1910-1960.

They significantly reworked Armstrong's plot (in the novel, Grandison is a theater producer and the mystery unfolds through his new secretary investigating her friend's death—though the film nods to this halfway through when we discover radio producer Jane was actually Roslyn's friend all along.)\nBosley Crowther suspected they were \"fashioning another Laura\" - and that opening with the angelic portrait presiding over a spooky mansion is pure Vera Caspary homage. But where Laura haunted men with her absence, Armstrong and Curtiz are interested in how one charming man controls the women around him. Grandison surrounds himself with dependent women - a ward, a niece, a secretary, a producer - carefully keeping them isolated from each other, never allowing them to compare notes or join forces against him.\nRains delivers magnificently, using that mellifluous voice to narrate crimes both fictional and real. Audrey Totter vamps wonderfully as the bitter, horny niece saddled with a sad-sack alcoholic husband, while Joan Caulfield plays the gaslit heiress with wide-eyed aplomb.\nThis sumptuous Gothic noir proves women's psychological suspense was fueling Hollywood's darkest dreams - even if the studios preferred style over psychology.\nIN THE DATABASE: Armstrong would go on to win an Edgar Award for A Dram of Poison (1956).

Productions/Tiffany Pictures\nWhen actor Myles Brent is shot dead while filming a death scene for a movie called The Death Kiss, the studio wants to call it an accident. But screenwriter Franklyn Drew (David Manners) turns amateur detective to clear his girlfriend's name, with bumbling help from studio cop Officer Gulliver.\nThis adaptation essentially throws out Madelon St. Dennis's novel about a strangling caught on newsreel, keeping only the title. The original featured Inspector Fisk and Sidney Traherne investigating a murder caught on newsreel footage—here we get a completely different, studio-set mystery.\nThe draw is supposed to be seeing Lugosi, Manners, and Van Sloan reunited just one year after Dracula, though Lugosi is criminally underused as a red herring studio manager. Director Edwin L. Marin (his debut!) shows surprising visual flair with swooping camera movements and hand-tinted color for the climactic shootout—innovations you wouldn't expect from poverty row.\nA fascinating artifact of Depression-era filmmaking—when even B-pictures could innovate and an author's name could sell tickets even if you junked her entire story.\nBut don't watch any of the public domain versions available on Youtube or Amazon Prime.

Crawford is tough but tender as Sadie McKee, the cook's daughter who follows her boyfriend Tommy to New York only to have him desert her hours before their wedding. Broke and heartbroken, she becomes a nightclub dancer, then marries a wealthy alcoholic who falls for her—all while navigating the judgment of her mother's employer's son, who happens to be the millionaire's lawyer.\nThis is pre-Code Hollywood at its most frank. When Sadie shows her friend Opal around her luxurious new apartment, confirming she doesn't have to sleep with her husband despite their marriage, Opal shrugs: \"Some girls do a lot more for a lot less.\" Released just two months before Production Code enforcement, the film can still acknowledge the sexual economics that underpin its romance plot.\nEdward Arnold delivers a heartbreaking performance as Brennan, the good-natured drunk who marries Sadie, nearly dies multiple times, then releases her when she confesses she still loves Tommy. His portrayal of alcoholic devotion is both pathetic and genuinely moving.\nThe MGM gloss includes stunning technical flourishes—watch for the long takes during the kitchen sequence near the beginning—and a perfect Automat scene that captures 1934 New York.\nIN THE DATABASE: Delmar was a Ten-Timer with 13 total adaptations!

This magazine serial (never published as a book) became the blueprint for Crawford's career.\n📚 herhollywoodstory.com/film/sadie-mckee-1934\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-27-sadie-mckee-1934/","path":"/log/2025-08-27-sadie-mckee-1934/","title":"Sadie McKee, 1934 - ★★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-27-the-damned-don-t-cry-1950/":{"body":"sadie mckee but make it noir\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-27-the-damned-don-t-cry-1950/","path":"/log/2025-08-27-the-damned-don-t-cry-1950/","title":"The Damned Don't Cry, 1950 - ★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-28-murder-by-death-1976/":{"body":"im just here for peter falk doing sam spade\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-28-murder-by-death-1976/","path":"/log/2025-08-28-murder-by-death-1976/","title":"Murder by Death, 1976 - ★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-31-the-toxic-avenger-2023/":{"body":"Watched on Sunday August 31, 2025.\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-08-31-the-toxic-avenger-2023/","path":"/log/2025-08-31-the-toxic-avenger-2023/","title":"The Toxic Avenger, 2023 - ★★½"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-06-emmanuelle-2024/":{"body":"Watched on Saturday September 6, 2025.\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-06-emmanuelle-2024/","path":"/log/2025-09-06-emmanuelle-2024/","title":"Emmanuelle, 2024 - ★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-21-the-long-walk-2025/":{"body":"somehow the most perfectly distilled version of stephen king’s mind\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-21-the-long-walk-2025/","path":"/log/2025-09-21-the-long-walk-2025/","title":"The Long Walk, 2025 - ★★★½"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-25-one-battle-after-another-2025/":{"body":"pta is the coolest motherfucker alive\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-25-one-battle-after-another-2025/","path":"/log/2025-09-25-one-battle-after-another-2025/","title":"One Battle After Another, 2025 - ★★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-26-spellbinder-1988/":{"body":"not good per se but kind of worth it for the ending\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-26-spellbinder-1988/","path":"/log/2025-09-26-spellbinder-1988/","title":"Spellbinder, 1988 - ★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-28-the-hem-2025/":{"body":"cast and crew premiere at the texas movie bistro. screams were screamed 👻\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-28-the-hem-2025/","path":"/log/2025-09-28-the-hem-2025/","title":"The Hem, 2025 - ★★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-30-a-bold-affair-1998/":{"body":"“it’s a COMPUTER. it’s not even real”\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-09-30-a-bold-affair-1998/","path":"/log/2025-09-30-a-bold-affair-1998/","title":"A Bold Affair, 1998 - ★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-10-01-the-hem-2025/":{"body":"weird wednesday screening at the location where they shot the film. great crowd, fun reactions to the scares 👻\nsee this review on letterboxd.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/log/2025-10-01-the-hem-2025/","path":"/log/2025-10-01-the-hem-2025/","title":"The Hem, 2025 - ★★★★★"},"https://nonmodernist.com/meta/":{"body":"","description":"Meta information about the site","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/meta/","path":"/meta/","title":"meta"},"https://nonmodernist.com/meta/dev-journal/":{"body":"This is my working journal for site development decisions, problems solved, and ideas for future improvements. It serves as both documentation and a reference for my future self.\nDesign Decisions\nStatus Updates\nDate: 2025-03-09\nImplemented a status update system to log my current thoughts and activities. This is a simple post type that allows me to jot down quick notes or updates. Inspired by Dame and styled to evoke web 2.0 vibes.\nWhy: I wanted a way to quickly log my current thoughts and activities without needing to create a full note. This allows for more spontaneous updates.\nImplementation:\n\nPosted to Bluesky through MacOS shortcut\nEchoed to GitHub by EchoFeed\n\nHomepage Counters\nDate: 2025-04-27\nImplemented a counter system to the site footer to display days since site launch, number of books read and movies watched:\n\n🎂 Days since launch\n📺 Total movies watched in my lifetime\n📖 Total books read in my lifetime\n\nWhy: This provides a quick overview of the kinds of things I used to log on commercial sites like Goodreads and Letterboxd (though I still use Letterboxd, because I love it), but now I can do it in my own space.\nKnown Issues:\n\nMovie and book counts are using fallback values for now\nNeed to find a way to automate these counts\n\nRelated Ideas:\n\nConsider adding a \"days since last update\" counter\n\nRecent Activity Section\nDate: 2025-04-29\nImplemented a \"recent activity\" section on the homepage to show my most recent status update, movie logged, and note added.\nWhy: This provides a quick overview of my recent activities and encourages me to keep the site updated. It also makes the homepage feel more dynamic.\nImplementation:\n\nAdded a new section to the homepage template\nUsed Zola's built-in recent_posts function to pull in the latest status update, movie, and note\nStyled the section to match the overall theme\n\nDigital Garden with Moon Phases\nDate: 2025-04-29\nConverted /notes/ section to digital garden-style collection. Implemented a moon phase progression system to visualize the maturity of notes:\n\n🌑 New idea (new)\n🌙 Beginning to take shape (waxing_crescent)\n🌓 Half-developed (first_quarter)\n🌔 Mostly formed (waxing_gibbous)\n🌕 Complete thought (full)\n\nWhy: This provides visual feedback on note maturity and creates a cohesive theme for the digital garden.\nImplementation:\n\nCustom Dividers\nDate: 2025-04-30\nCreated several divider styles with moon and star motifs to support the celestial theme:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhy: Enhances visual interest while maintaining thematic consistency.\nImplementation:\n\nRelated Notes Section and Backlinks\nDate: 2025-05-01\nImplemented \"related notes\" and \"backlinks\" sections on the note pages to show links to other notes with similar tags or content.\nWhy: This encourages exploration of related content and helps users discover more of my notes.\nImplementation:\n\nRelated Notes:\n\nAdded new partial to display related notes\nCurrently using frontmatter to hardcode related notes, but will automate this in the future\n\n\nBacklinks:\n\nAdded a new partial to display backlinks\nUsed Zola's built-in backlinks function\n\n\n\nNote: If a note has backlinks, it will not show the related notes section to avoid redundancy.\nProblems Solved\nSafari rendering pixel borders incorrectly\nDate: 2025-05-03\nProblem: Safari was rendering the pixel corners incorrectly on images, causing jagged edges and visual artifacts.\nSolution: Adjusted CSS clip-path to use explicit pixel values rather than percentages:\n\nFiles Modified:\n\nsass/parts/_image.scss\n\nUnifont resized and converted to woff2\nDate: 2025-05-04\nProblem: The Unifont font was slowing down the site due to its size.\nSolution: Extracted Latin extended characters to new font file and converted to woff2 format for better performance.\nFiles Modified:\n\nsass/fonts.scss\n\nFuture Improvements\nInvert moon phase indications in dark mode\nPlanned: When in dark mode, invert the moon phase icons being called so that they maintain their meaning.\nCreate custom 404 page with moon theme\nPlanned: Design a themed 404 page that fits with the moon garden concept.\nIdeas:\n\nUse a \"dark side of the moon\" visual\nAdd a \"lost in space\" theme\nInclude a site map to help users find their way\n\nAutomate movie and book counts\nPlanned: Find a way to automate the movie and book counts in the footer.\nIdeas:\n\nUse an API to pull in data from Letterboxd\nRefactor /reading/ to automatically count books read\n\nAdd a \"days since last update\" counter\nPlanned: Create a counter to show the number of days since the last update.\nIdeas:\n\nUse a simple JavaScript function to calculate the difference between today and the last update date\nDisplay the counter in the footer\nNeed to figure out how to implement this in Zolas\n\nAdd a \"moon phase\" filter for notes\nPlanned: Create a filter to view notes by their moon phase.\nIdeas:\n\nUse a dropdown or toggle to select the moon phase\nFilter the notes displayed on the page based on the selected phase\n\nColor code emojis\nPlanned: Implement a system to color code OG emojis based on the original DoCoMo emoji colors.\nBreaking Changes\nRestyled callouts\nDate: 2025-05-01\n\nDeleted callout template from templates/partials/note.html\nAdded new callout styles to _garden.scss\nCallouts are now created in html using the callout class\n\nReason: The old callout template was too complex and introduced spacing issues that I could not solve. The new styles are simpler and easier to use.\nUpdated SCSS structure\nDate: 2025-05-03\n\nSplit _garden.scss into separate components\nChanged moon phase class naming convention from phase-new to moon-phase-new\nModified the card styling mixins to use consistent borders\n\nMigration: Update any custom templates using the old class names.\nFiles

Do you know that feeling? It's exceptionally frustrating.\nThe idea is simple: I want to build a wiki that collects the various stuff I use to teach different classes. Things like: the timeline of optical toys that I give my multimedia authoring students, or the list of folk horror tropes that I developed after teaching a genre in film course on the topic.\nThere are any number of solutions to this problem, but I can't seem to sort out which works best.

Two immediate problems arise in my mind: 1) where do I put it? and 2) what do I call it?\nBrainstorming possible names got me thinking about my online identities and how I do or don't manage what gets included under their umbrellas. So here are some disorganized thoughts about it.\nWhat's in a handle?\nI changed my primary online handle to \"nonmodernist\" while I was finishing my masters degree. It was a word I found in an academic book I was reading—unfortunately I will likely never remember which one—that called for an expansion of the study of \"nonmodernist\" literature of the early 20th century. It struck a chord (yes! that is what I wanted to do!) and it has stuck with me as my academic career has progressed and my research agenda has shifted. \"nonmodernist\" has become not just what I want to do, but the actual foundation of my career. I love modernist literature, but it's over-studied, while so much incredible literature and media from the same era hasn't been studied enough (if at all!).\nWhither to blog?\nThe problem is, the nonmodernist.com domain is currently a catch-all for both my academic and personal identities. So while a \"nonmodernist\" blog might seem like a logical place to put thoughts on the film and literature I study, it also feels a bit too personal. Too casual. A place where I might type in all lowercase and misuse the word \"whither.\"\ntbh I am probably overthinking all of this and I should just buckle down and start blogging. smh etc etc.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThis note captures my thinking about online identity and potential new blogging projects.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/2025-02-10-on-nonmodernist/","path":"/notes/2025-02-10-on-nonmodernist/","title":"on 'nonmodernist'"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/ai-image-experiment-computer-shrine/":{"body":"My ongoing exploration of AI image generation includes several experiments that help me understand the capabilities, limitations, and aesthetic tendencies of these systems. This note documents one such experiment: an iterative journey through different AI systems to develop the concept of a computer shrine in a garden setting.\nThe Evolution of a Digital Shrine\n\n  \n    \n  \n  The starting point: Created with DeepAI using the prompt \"Sci-fi Community Computer Garden\". This initial output features a vibrant, hyper-saturated aesthetic with a vintage computer nestled in a fantastical garden.\n\nI began with a simple prompt in DeepAI: \"Sci-fi Community Computer Garden.\" The result featured a vibrant, almost psychedelic garden with a vintage computer displaying a cosmic scene. What caught my attention was how the AI had placed the computer at the end of a stone path, giving it an almost shrine-like quality.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Second iteration: Created with DeepAI using the prompt \"A winding path of moss-covered stones leading towards a radiant computer shrine in a vibrant solarpunk garden, bathed in dappled sunlight, cute anime style, intricate details.\" The AI transformed the computer into something like a traditional Japanese shrine structure.\n\nIntrigued by this shrine-like interpretation, I refined my prompt to explicitly request \"a radiant computer shrine\" while adding elements like \"moss-covered stones,\" \"dappled sunlight,\" and \"cute anime style.\" DeepAI responded by generating an image heavily influenced by Studio Ghibli aesthetics, featuring a traditional Japanese shrine at the end of a stone path. While aesthetically pleasing, I found this image to be boring and too derivative.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Third iteration: Created with DeepAI using the prompt \"A computer shrine powered by solar panels, situated at the end of a winding stone path lined with bioluminescent plants, within a whimsical solarpunk garden, linocut\". This produced a striking minimalist interpretation with a graphic, printmaking quality.\n\nFor my third attempt, I kept the core concept but added more technological elements and specified a different artistic style: \"A computer shrine powered by solar panels... whimsical solarpunk garden, linocut.\" This resulted in a dramatic stylistic shift—a minimalist, graphic illustration reminiscent of linocut prints, featuring a vintage computer beneath a solar panel.\nThe image includes a generated nonsense label or title and an approximation of a copyright mark. This suggests that the AI is attempting to create a more 'authentic' artifact, but it also points to the likelihood of DeepAI's training data including copyrighted material.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Final iteration: Created by feeding Image 3 to Adobe's Text-to-Image generator. The result maintains the core symbolic elements while developing a richer aesthetic with detailed texturing, retrofuturist styling, and a more complex visual narrative.\n\nFor the final iteration, I fed the third image into Adobe's Text-to-Image generator. The result was a synthesis and evolution—maintaining the core elements (computer, solar panel, garden path) while developing a more sophisticated aesthetic with detailed texturing, retrofuturist styling, and a cosmic portal displayed on the screen. The flowers became more prominent, creating a striking color contrast with the predominantly blue-green scene.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nAesthetic Evolution and Observations\nThis experiment reveals several interesting aspects of AI image generation:\n\n\nAesthetic Progression: The images move from fantasy-like saturation to traditional serenity to graphic minimalism to detailed retrofuturism—demonstrating how different systems interpret similar concepts through distinct visual languages.\n\n\nSymbolic Consistency: The stone pathway remains a consistent compositional element across all iterations, though its rendering evolves in the final iteration.\n\n\nConcept Transformation: The representation of technology shifts from literal (vintage computer) to metaphorical (shrine) and back to literal but progressively more abstract and cosmic.\n\n\nColor Evolution: The color palettes vary significantly—from vibrant complementary colors in the first image, to natural greens and yellows in the second, to restrained black and white in the third, to rich blues and oranges with textural depth in the fourth.\n\n\nReflections on the Process\nFor me, this experiment demonstrates how AI image generation can be used in a critical making process, with each output informing subsequent prompts and systems. It reveals both the constraints of these systems (how they interpret and sometimes transform conceptual elements into derivative depictions) and their creative potential when used in an exploratory fashion.\nGiven the likelihood of DeepAI's training data including copyrighted material, I find myself unlikely to use it for \"final\" versions of images. I feel more comfortable using Adobe's system, which has been trained on their stock image library, suggesting artists have been at least somewhat compensated for their work.\nThe next step in this experiment will likely involve using the final generated image as a \"prompt\" for my own drawing or painting, allowing me to explore the intersection of AI-generated imagery and human creativity. This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of how these systems can inform and inspire traditional artistic practices.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nQuestions for Further Exploration\nSystem Boundaries and Interpretations\n\nHow do different AI systems prioritize elements in complex prompts?\nWhen does a system choose to transform a concept rather than represent it literally?\nHow do aesthetics from different traditions get encoded in and reproduced by these systems?\n\nProcess and Methodology\n\nWhat are the advantages of iterative approaches to AI image generation?\nHow might using multiple systems in sequence enhance creative possibilities?\nWhat is lost and gained as images move between systems and prompts?\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis exploration connects to my broader investigations of AI aesthetics and solarpunk as pedagogy.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/ai-image-experiment-computer-shrine/","path":"/notes/ai-image-experiment-computer-shrine/","title":"Text-to-Image Evolution: Computer Shrine"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/ai-image-experiment/":{"body":"This site uses text-to-image generation to illustrate some of its pages, including my commonplace books note. This is intended as an experiment in visual communication, conducted in the spirit of critical making.\nWhat is Critical Making?\nCritical making combines the act of creating with critical analysis, fostering a dual engagement in hands-on production and reflective thought. This approach encourages both students and practitioners to explore the broader social, cultural, and ethical dimensions of the artifacts they produce.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  An AI-generated illustration of \"pages from a field journal for a low carbon future. An artist has created watercolor sketches of plans for a scifi community computer garden.\" Created by Adobe Text to Image, which uses assets from the extensive Adobe stock image library.\n\nBy directly working with text-to-image systems rather than just theorizing about them, I hope to develop a more nuanced understanding of their tendencies, limitations, and social impacts.\nMethodology\nThis is a casual experiment with no formal structure. I use various text-to-image generation tools to create illustrations for select notes in this digital garden. The images are generated using prompts derived from the content of the notes, sometimes with modifications to achieve desired aesthetic results.\nI always include the tool used and the original prompt in the image metadata, which I hope creates transparency around this experiment. My intention is to make the process visible, not to hide the technology behind them or present them as \"authentic\" images.\nI reflect on both the process of creating these images and their relationship to the text they accompany. Questions that arise during this process become part of the experiment itself, documented here and in related notes.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nExperiment 1: Botanical Prints\nI began this experiment with a simple prompt: \"field of rudbeckia, warm colors, linocut.\" I wanted to see how different systems interpreted this prompt and what aesthetic choices they made. The results varied, showcasing the unique characteristics of each system. Both tools I used—Adobe's text-to-image generator and DeepAI—were able to create botanically accurate images, but they also introduced their own stylistic interpretations.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  AI approximation of a \"field of rudbeckia, warm colors, linocut,\" created with DeepAI. This first image uses a minimalist pop art style, featuring a field of yellow black-eyed susans rendered as almost-geometric patterns against a bold red background. This interpretation prioritizes graphic simplicity and strong color contrast over botanical detail.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Retro-style AI illustration of rudbeckia at sunset, combining 1960s-70s children's book aesthetics with warm color harmonies, created with the same prompt and tool as the previous image. The large setting sun creates a nostalgic atmosphere while the flowers, though stylized, display the most accurate leaf shapes.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Art Nouveau-inspired AI depiction of rudbeckia with flowing lines and rhythmic patterns. This interpretation, created by Adobe Text to Image, draws from woodblock print traditions with its ornamental mountain backdrop and decorative botanical detail, representing perhaps the most 'artistic' of AI's style interpretations.\n\nThese three AI-generated images demonstrate how computational image generators, which create visuals through statistical pattern matching rather than genuine understanding, interpret the same subject—fields of black-eyed susans—through different aesthetic lenses. While all three depict repetitive floral landscapes, they range from simplified graphic design to retro illustration to Art Nouveau-inspired decorative arts.\nThe first two images, both from DeepAI, notably evoke the work of Ilonka Karász, particularly her New Yorker cover illustrations from the 1940s-60s, with their bold color blocking, flattened perspectives, and warm palette reminiscent of mid-century graphic design. The third image, using Adobe Express, diverges toward a more ornamental, printmaking-inspired style. What's particularly fascinating is how each interpretation maintains the core subject matter while expressing different artistic philosophies—from pattern-based minimalism to nostalgic warmth to decorative complexity—revealing the multiple aesthetic \"knowledge bases\" embedded within AI image generation systems.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nExperiment 2: Solarpunk Computer Shrine\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Created with DeepAI using the prompt \"Sci-fi Community Computer Garden.\" The appearance of the computer like a shrine in a garden inspired me to explore this idea further. \n\nVisit the computer shrine.\nQuestions to Explore\nAesthetic Considerations\n\nWhat visual aesthetics do these systems tend to replicate?\nHow do these systems interpret ambiguity and abstraction?\nWhat happens at the boundary between the describable and the indescribable?\nHow do different systems handle the same prompts, and what does this reveal about their training?\n\nEthical Concerns\n\nHow do these systems reproduce (or challenge) existing power structures?\nWhat biases emerge in generated imagery?\nWho benefits from and who is harmed by these technologies?\nFollowing Dan McQuillan's work on AI ethics, how might these systems contribute to algorithmic fascism through aesthetics?\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis exploration connects to my broader interest in pre-cinema technologies, the development of photography, and how new visual technologies shape our understanding of the world.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/ai-image-experiment/","path":"/notes/ai-image-experiment/","title":"Text-to-Image Generation: A Critical Experiment"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/commonplace-books/":{"body":"📖 My relationship with commonplace books began during my master's program, where I worked on transcribing these fascinating historical documents at the library. This interest deepened in 2016 when I participated in an NEH summer seminar focused on commonplace books and scrapbooks while writing my dissertation. That experience fundamentally shaped how I think about knowledge organization and curation—concepts that inform this digital garden.\nWhat is a Commonplace Book?\n\nA commonplace book is at once a book form and a method of reading. Commonplacing was a system of using books in which readers digested the books they read by extracting, ordering and recording particular phrases or passages in notebooks of their own. This process encouraged readers to atomize books by isolating units that might later be useful in one or another discursive context. While the commonplace book allowed readers to personalize their reading by making it useful, this process of textual engagement was also highly prescribed, \"common\" in the sense that it filtered one's reading through social norms that determined what was textually significant and what not. —Commonplace Thinking, UChicago Library\n\nThese collections began as blank books that gradually filled with quotes, observations, and ideas the owner encountered and wanted to preserve. The practice encouraged atomizing texts—breaking them into useful, reusable fragments that could be referenced later.\nMethod and Purpose\nThe commonplace book served multiple functions:\n\nA personal knowledge repository\nA conversation starter\nA memory aid\nA method of processing what one read\n\nUnlike modern note-taking, which often organizes by source or chronology, commonplace books organized by theme or topic, creating unexpected juxtapositions between ideas from different sources.\n\n[!quote] Booke and e-book: The Future of the Book\n\"The commonplace book began blank. The reader used it to collect premises, arguments and other quotes from the various books read. The commonplace book was always at hand for the next addition or as a conversational prompt. It might well fill up with contradictory snippets.\"&nbsp;\n\nThis tolerance for contradiction distinguishes commonplace books from more systematic knowledge tools—they weren't meant to present a coherent worldview but rather to capture diverse perspectives that might prove useful in different contexts.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nCommonplace Books and Florilegia\nThe practice of commonplacing connects directly to the medieval tradition of the florilegium (plural: florilegia), literally \"a gathering of flowers.\" These collections contained excerpts from authoritative texts, usually organized by subject.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  This botanical book illustration was created using Adobe Express's 'Generate Image' feature. I provided the prompt 'florilegia - a commonplace book of flowers' and selected the style modifiers 'nostalgic,' 'beautiful,' and 'line drawing' to achieve this vintage engraving-style result with its delicate botanical details and decorative borders. \n\nThe metaphor of gathering flowers—selecting the most beautiful or useful parts—perfectly captures the essence of both commonplace books and digital gardens. We cultivate ideas, collect the most vibrant specimens, and arrange them in ways that create new meaning through juxtaposition.\nFrom Commonplace Books to Digital Gardens\nThe parallels between historical commonplace books and today's digital gardens are striking:\n\nHypertextual thinking: Though lacking literal hyperlinks, commonplace books created associative connections between ideas through topical organization.\nPersonal curation: Both forms privilege personal relevance over comprehensive coverage.\nNon-linear organization: Neither needs to be read in order from beginning to end.\nEvolving collections: Both grow and change over time as new ideas are encountered.\nPublic/private balance: Commonplace books, though private, were often shared in social settings as conversation starters—similar to how digital gardens are personal yet publicly accessible.\n\nDigital Gardening as Modern Commonplacing\nMy approach to this digital garden is directly inspired by the tradition of commonplace books and florilegia. I view these notes as my own collection of \"flowers\"—ideas worth preserving and connections worth exploring. Like the commonplace books I studied and transcribed, this space embraces contradiction, prizes interesting juxtapositions, and evolves organically over time.\nThe digital medium offers new possibilities that traditional commonplace keepers could only dream of—the ability to easily reorganize, to create explicit rather than implied connections, and to share selectively with others. Yet the core purpose remains the same: to cultivate a personal landscape of knowledge that reflects my intellectual journey.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of my exploration of historical knowledge practices and their modern digital counterparts.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/commonplace-books/","path":"/notes/commonplace-books/","title":"Commonplace Books as Gardens of Thought"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/digital-archiving-personal/":{"body":"I recently found the blog I kept from 2006-2008.

Unlike photographs or physical mementos, personal writing captures not just events but thought processes, priorities, and your particular voice at that time.\nDigital Gardens as Continuity\nThis experience highlights one value of maintaining a digital garden—creating continuity between past and present selves. Unlike social media's emphasis on immediacy and constant updates, digital gardens allow ideas to evolve while preserving their history. The garden format acknowledges that our thinking develops over time, with some ideas growing from seedlings to fully-developed concepts while others may lie dormant before eventually flourishing.\nSelective Preservation\nNot everything from our past digital lives deserves preservation. I'm being highly selective about which entries to migrate from the old blog, focusing on those with enduring value or interest rather than those that now make me cringe.\nThere's a curatorial process in deciding which parts of our past selves to integrate into our current digital identity—which in some ways mirrors how memory itself functions by preserving certain experiences while allowing others to fade.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nI'm considering starting a collection of notes on digital preservation practices and the evolution of online self-representation.

It immediately made me think of the pre-blog web in a way that sparked my curiosity and imagination. Thinking on it further, I was reminded of commonplace books, Twine games, and self-replicating web art projects like Trash Robot. I love gardens. I wanted to try it out.\nWhy a \"digital garden\"?\nWhen I was a young teen, I was really interested in neopagan worldviews like Wicca. (Yes, I watched The Craft a lot in this era.) This was pre-social media, pre-Web 2.0, even pre-blogging. My mom worked for a major telecom company, so we had free internet, and I loved to spend hours navigating the web as it existed then, researching neopaganism and marveling at the various ways that the web creators of the era used metaphors to help users navigate their sites.\nThere was a poetry and a freedom to user interface design—rather than using \"the blog\" as their organizing strategy, these creators built labyrinths and villages and, yes, gardens of deeply interlinked evergreen content. I lost interest in neopaganism after a while, but I've never lost my fondness for that time on the web.\nI miss when we treated more websites a little like text adventure games, when discovery was part of the joy of using the internet, when designers and creators didn't default to what everyone else did but embraced experimentation. In this space, I want to bring that feeling back, at least for myself if not for others.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nI also appreciate the garden metaphor because I spend a lot of time thinking about how computers help or hinder our ability to be in relationship with the ecosystems around us. In 2023, I developed a multimedia authoring course on apps and ebooks called \"Shadow Libraries and Solarpunk Futures,\" where one of the goals was to get students doing this kind of thinking about the relationship between digital technology and \"nature.\"\nI focused on solarpunk because I wanted us to find hope for the future.

In the early 19th century, artists and inventors worked to perfect the process of combining these principles to create photographic images.\nEarly Photographic Milestones\nFirst Surviving Photograph (1827)\nThe oldest surviving photographic image was created by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1827. It shows a view of buildings and countryside, taken from a high window.\nFirst Photograph with People (1838)\nIn 1838, Louis Daguerre created an image that is widely thought to be the first photograph containing people. However, the image took so long to expose that only two figures who stood still can be seen.\nWomen in Early Photography\nWomen also experimented with photography from its earliest era. The first known photograph by a woman is an image of a leaf, taken in 1839 by Sarah Anne Bright.\n\n\nIn the United States, portrait photography became especially popular, leading to portrait studios in every city. Augustus Washington, a free man of color born in New Jersey, opened his own photography studio in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1846. He took the first photographs of his fellow abolitionist John Brown in 1846 or 1847.\nMotion Studies and Chronophotography\nMuybridge's Horse in Motion (1878)\nIn the 1870s, photographer Eadweard Muybridge was hired by Leland Stanford to photograph a horse. Muybridge spent most of the decade working out how to expose an image fast enough to capture a galloping horse. By 1878, with the help of some railroad engineers, Muybridge devised a way to take not just one but a sequence of photographs of a moving subject.\nRebecca Solnit's book River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West provides an excellent account of this process and its cultural significance.\n\n\nMuybridge spent another 10 years photographing animals and humans in motion. He also invented the zoopraxiscope to demonstrate moving illustrations based on his photographs.\nMarey's Chronophotography (1882)\nMeanwhile, in 1882, Étienne-Jules Marey devised a means of taking 12 photographs per second, using a mechanism that looked like a gun. He was soon able to push this up to 30 frames per second. Unlike Muybridge's motion studies, which used separate cameras to photograph onto separate plates, Marey's use of a single camera allowed him to expose multiple images on the same glass plate or strip of photographic paper.\n\n\nDevelopment of Flexible Film (1889)\nIn 1889, George Eastman's photography company began selling a flexible celluloid film stock that was more durable than paper. Eastman's company also created the first film roll system and the sprocket holes that allow film to be advanced inside the camera. This proved useful not only for still photographers, who no longer had to carry heavy glass plates, but also for budding motion picture photographers, as it brought them even closer to being able to expose the hundreds of frames needed to capture more than a few seconds of motion.\nCultural Notes\nThe development of photography and motion studies wasn't merely a technical achievement—it represented a fundamental shift in how humans understood and documented the world.\nMotion studies revealed aspects of movement invisible to the naked eye, changing our understanding of animal locomotion and human motion. These studies also created visual language conventions that would influence early filmmakers, who often employed a documentary approach similar to Muybridge's analytical framing.\nThere's also a fascinating connection between these early motion studies and modern cinema. For example, Jordan Peele's film Nope (2022) references Muybridge's work, though it takes some creative license with the historical details.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring the pre-history of cinema.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/early-photography/","path":"/notes/early-photography/","title":"Early Photography and Motion Studies"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/early-sound-recording/":{"body":"🎵 While the visual technologies that led to cinema developed throughout the 19th century, parallel innovations in sound recording were laying the groundwork for what would eventually become synchronized sound film. The path to recorded sound followed its own distinct trajectory before eventually converging with moving images.\nEarly Sound Recording Innovations\nThe Phonautograph (1850s)\nThe earliest known device for recording sound, called the phonautograph, was invented in France in the 1850s by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. The device recorded a visual representation of soundwaves on paper or glass, but it was not originally designed with playback capabilities.\nRemarkably, it did not occur to anyone before the 1870s that these recordings, called phonautograms, contained enough information about the sound that they could, in theory, be used to recreate it. Because the phonautogram tracing was an insubstantial two-dimensional line, direct physical playback was impossible at the time.\nIn a fascinating development from 2008, several phonautograms recorded before 1861 were successfully played as sound by optically scanning them and using computer processing to convert the scans into digital audio files. This allowed us to hear recordings made over 150 years earlier that were never meant to be played back.\nEdison's Phonograph (1870s)\nIn the 1870s, Thomas Edison began working on a device that could both record sound and play it back. His breakthrough came with the phonograph, which used a stylus to inscribe sound vibrations onto a rotating cylinder covered with tinfoil (later wax).\nTo play back the recording, another stylus would trace these grooves, with the resulting vibrations amplified through a horn. This physical approach to sound reproduction differed fundamentally from the visual approach of the phonautograph.\nCompeting Technologies\nThroughout the 1880s, various inventors including Alexander Graham Bell and Emile Berliner refined sound recording technologies. Berliner's gramophone, which used flat discs rather than cylinders, would eventually become the dominant format for consumer audio.\nConnection to Early Cinema\nThe development of sound recording ran largely parallel to, rather than in conjunction with, the development of motion pictures. When W.K.L. Dickson created what is considered the first experiment in synchronized sound film in 1894 or 1895, he had to use two separate technologies:\n\nA kinetoscope for the visual component\nA phonograph for the audio component\n\nThe challenge of synchronizing these separate devices would remain a significant technical hurdle for decades, with various systems attempting to solve the problem before the introduction of optical sound-on-film technology in the late 1920s.\nCultural Impact\nSound recording technologies changed our relationship with time and memory in ways similar to photography. Just as photographs allowed visual moments to be captured and revisited, sound recording permitted aural experiences to be preserved and replayed.\nThis ability to capture ephemeral sensory experiences laid important cultural groundwork for the eventual acceptance of cinema as a medium that could reproduce reality in increasingly comprehensive ways.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring the pre-history of cinema.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/early-sound-recording/","path":"/notes/early-sound-recording/","title":"Early Sound Recording Technologies"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/film-industry-history/":{"body":"😠 Sometimes things make me frowny face so hard that I have to write about them. I call it \"the grump.\" This grump is about when journalists and essayists write sweeping declarations about film history without actually... studying the history of the film industry!!\nNow, it's true that I'm a contrarian who has built an academic career around studying things that other people think are inconsequential and would probably rather forget. But it's also true that it's not that hard to read a book about how the film industry operated as a business in the first half of the 20th century. And when a writer doesn't do that, that writer can end up making appallingly ahistorical arguments in a major outlet.\nThe Netflix Misconception\nTake, for example, this claim by Will Tavlin in an n+1 essay about how Netflix broke the movies:\n\nFor a century, the business of running a Hollywood studio was straightforward. The more people watched films, the more money the studios made. With Netflix, however, audiences don't pay for individual films. They pay a subscription to watch everything, and this has enabled a strange phenomenon to take root. Netflix's movies don't have to abide by any of the norms established over the history of cinema: they don't have to be profitable, pretty, sexy, intelligent, funny, well-made, or anything else that pulls audiences into theater seats.\n\nIt sounds reasonably well-argued, and yet it is simply not true. It's so not true that the United States government took Paramount Pictures all the way to the Supreme Court about it in 1948. The resulting anti-trust standard, known as the Paramount Decree, completely reshaped Hollywood, ended the studio system, paved the way for European, arthouse, and porn cinema to gain popularity in the US, and eventually led (albeit indirectly) to Rudy Giuliani being a man we had to watch sweat out his hair dye in public.\nThe Block-Booking Reality\nWhen the US won its Supreme Court case against Paramount in 1948, the resulting judgement forced the major movie studios to do a couple of things, including end the long-established practice known as \"blind buying,\" and reduce the amount of \"block booking\" they could force exhibitors into. So while an audience member pre-1948 might have paid for an individual film (but more likely a double feature, or a program of shorts and a feature), the theatres themselves were forced to essentially \"subscribe\" to a block of a studio's output, sight unseen.\nThe studios loved this pre-1948 arrangement, because it meant they could produce mostly forgettable garbage (film prints were literally thrown away once they had been screened enough times) alongside a small handful of big budget, quality pictures with big stars that were guaranteed to draw audiences. Small theatre chains and independent exhibitors, on the other hand, were trapped in a deal with the devil: if they wanted the big pictures that equaled big ticket sales, they had to junk up their schedules with the dreck, too. Again, this was such a problem that the US Supreme Court had to step in.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nQuality vs. Quantity in Studio Output\nTavlin goes on to write that \"high output alone can't account for Netflix's garbage quality. In the 1920s and '30s, studios like Paramount and Warner Bros. put out as many as seventy movies per year,\" without asking whether or not all 70 movies in a year would have been good, successful, or even marginally memorable.\nOf course they weren't.\nLet's take Paramount's 1933 for example: out of the 60 films the studio released that year, there are some gems, like the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup and Ernst Lubitsch's Design for Living (the former is now in the Library of Congress, the latter in the Criterion Collection). There are a couple of lesser-known films with historical significance, like the Mae West-Cary Grant sex comedy She Done Him Wrong (in the LoC) and the Mae West-Cary Grant sex comedy I'm No Angel.\nThere's also the brutal William Faulkner adaptation The Story of Temple Drake, which was only recently restored and made widely available (and is also in the Criterion Collection). But have you ever even heard of The Thundering Herd or College Humor or King of the Jungle or Hello, Everybody! or Big Executive or Song of the Eagle, let alone seen them? How about International House, Tillie and Gus, or the live-action Alice in Wonderland, all of which starred W.C. Fields (who also had 5 short films distributed in theatres during the same year)?\nThe Mythical Golden Age of Exhibition\nI've grumped too long already but it's also worth mentioning that our idea of a quiet, respectful, fully-engaged moviegoing experience (as opposed to the distracted viewing we do at home) is fundamentally ahistorical as well. For most of moviegoing history, the theatre was not a place where we viewed movies without distractions. Quite the opposite, especially in the era when a movie ran back-to-back all day long and patrons could enter and exit at any point. (And then there was the porn theatre era...)\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nWith all of that said, \"Tide Pod cinema\" is a wonderful phrase, and I do think it describes something important about contemporary streaming cinema. But I maintain that the point could be made without lapsing into ahistoricism!\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/film-industry-history/","path":"/notes/film-industry-history/","title":"Film Industry History: Subscription Models Aren't New"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/folk-horror-animal-transformation/":{"body":"🐶 The transformation of humans into animals is a recurring motif in folk horror, drawing on widespread folkloric traditions of shapeshifting.

As a trope, it embodies the tension between individual rights and communal needs, modern values and ancient practices. The ritualistic killing of humans for the perceived benefit of the community appears consistently across folk horror from different cultures and eras.\nFunctions of Sacrifice in Folk Horror\nFertility and Prosperity\nMany folk horror films link human sacrifice to agricultural fertility or community prosperity:\n\nThe Wicker Man (1972, UK)\nMidsommar (2019, US/Sweden)\n\nThese sacrifices are typically performed to ensure good harvests or end periods of hardship.\nAppeasement of Supernatural Forces\nSacrifice as a means to placate gods, spirits, or monsters:\n\nBlood on Satan's Claw (1971, UK)\nTumbbad (2018, India)\nThe Ritual (2017, UK)\n\nThese narratives often involve entities that demand regular tributes in exchange for leaving the community in peace.\nPurification\nSacrifice as a means of cleansing the community of perceived impurity:\n\nWitchfinder General (1968, UK)\n\nThese films often reflect historical witch hunts and moral panics.\nChoice of Victims\nThe selection of sacrificial victims in folk horror follows several patterns:\nThe Outsider\nThe most common sacrificial victim is the outsider who has entered the community:\n\nThe Wicker Man (1972, UK)\nApostle (2018, US)\nMidsommar (2019, US/Sweden)\n\nUsing outsiders as victims reinforces the community's boundaries and cohesion.\nThe Lottery\nSome films depict randomized selection processes:\n\nThe Lottery (1969, US), based on Shirley Jackson's story\n\nThese systems distribute the burden of sacrifice across the community.\nThe Volunteer\nWilling sacrifices appear in some folk horror narratives:\n\nThe Vigil (2019, US)\nLamb (2021, Iceland)\n\nThese characters often sacrifice themselves to protect others or fulfill perceived duties.\nCultural Context\nHuman sacrifice in folk horror draws on both historical practices and colonial misrepresentations of indigenous cultures. While ritualistic killing has existed in many ancient societies, colonial powers often exaggerated or fabricated accounts of sacrifice to justify conquest and conversion efforts.\nModern folk horror frequently engages with this complex history, sometimes reproducing problematic stereotypes but increasingly offering more nuanced perspectives that examine the colonial gaze itself.\nNarrative Function\nBeyond its plot significance, human sacrifice in folk horror serves several narrative functions:\n\nClimactic revelation - Often reserved for the film's climax, revealing the true nature of the community\nMoral confrontation - Forces characters (and audiences) to confront different value systems\nMetaphorical commentary - Can represent broader social critiques about how societies sacrifice individuals\nViolation of taboo - Creates horror through the transgression of fundamental moral boundaries\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring folk horror in cinema.

In Slavic folk horror, for example, \"someone is already immersed in this value system, and whatever happens in this plot arises from within.\"\nThis cultural difference highlights how folk horror varies across regions, reflecting different relationships to tradition and modernity.\nNarrative Functions\nThe outsider character serves several important functions in folk horror narratives:\n\nAudience Surrogate - Allows viewers to learn about the community alongside the character\nCultural Contrast - Creates tension between modern and traditional worldviews\nMoral Warning - Often punished for their intrusion, skepticism, or disrespect\nColonial Subtext - Can represent broader themes of colonialism and cultural appropriation\n\nThe Ethnographic Gaze\nThe prevalence of ethnographers and academics in folk horror reflects the genre's connection to the history of folklore studies. The \"ethnographic gaze\" - the perspective of an outside observer documenting \"primitive\" customs - often becomes inverted in these films, with the observer becoming the observed, the documenter becoming the documented.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring folk horror in cinema.

This isolation allows for the development of unique social dynamics, preservation of ancient practices, and the flourishing of beliefs that might be suppressed in more connected communities.\nTypes of Rural Settings in Folk Horror\nVillages and Small Towns\nSmall, close-knit communities feature prominently in folk horror, including:\n\nThe White Reindeer (1952, Finland)\nSatan's Feasts in the Village of Leva-e-Traz (1967, Brazil)\nLeptirica (1973, Yugoslavia)\nThe Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978, US)\nThe Witch (2015, US)\nThe Wailing (2016, South Korea)\nWhen Evil Lurks (2023, Argentina)\n\nThese settings often feature communities that have developed in isolation over generations, allowing unusual or archaic practices to continue unchecked.\nFarms and Fields\nAgricultural settings link folk horror to fertility rituals, seasonal cycles, and humanity's connection to the land:\n\nCrowhaven Farm (1970, US)\nBlood on Satan's Claw (1971, UK)\nChildren of the Corn (1984, US)\nA Field in England (2013, UK)\n\nForests\nForests represent primordial wilderness and untamed nature, serving as liminal spaces where traditional rules break down:\n\nKuroneko (1968, Japan)\nEyes of Fire (1983, US)\nThe Enchanted (1984)\nThe Blair Witch Project (1999, US)\nRoh (2019, Malaysia)\n\nIslands\nIslands offer the ultimate isolation, creating microcosms where unique social systems can develop entirely separate from mainstream society:\n\nThe Wicker Man (1972, UK)\nIo Island (1977, South Korea)\n\nIsolated Houses\nLarge, remote houses functioning as outposts on the edge of rural locales create their own form of isolation:\n\nLokis: A Manuscript of Professor Wittembach (1970, Poland)\nLet's Scare Jessica to Death (1971, US)\nGanja &amp; Hess (1973, US)\nThe Ash Tree (1975, UK)\nThe Rites of May (1976, Philippines)\nLa Llorona (2019, Guatemala)\n\nVacation Settings\nFolk horror frequently exploits the vulnerability of visitors to rural areas:\n\nLake of the Dead (1958, Norway)\nHour of the Wolf (1968, Sweden)\nDeliverance (1972, US)\nButter on the Latch (2015, US)\nMidsommar (2019, US/Sweden)\n\nUrban Folk Horror\nWhile rare, some folk horror films adapt the genre's tropes to urban settings. Candyman (1992, US) is a notable example, though one could argue that the Cabrini-Green housing project in the film functions as an isolated community within the larger urban landscape, effectively serving as the modern equivalent of a remote village.\nHistorical Context\nFolk horror's focus on rurality connects to the 19th-century origins of folklore studies, when European ethnographers traveled to rural areas to collect folklore from illiterate, poor communities. This history informs the genre's frequent use of the outsider/ethnographer figure observing rural customs.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring folk horror in cinema.

These spirits typically emerge from local folkloric traditions and often represent historical traumas or unresolved injustices particular to their regions of origin.\nRegional Ghost Traditions in Folk Horror\nJapanese Ghost Traditions\nJapanese folk horror features several distinct types of vengeful spirits:\n\nBakeneko: A Vengeful Spirit (1968, Japan) - The ghost cat tradition where women return as feline spirits to seek revenge\nKuroneko (1968, Japan) - Another ghost cat narrative emphasizing female vengeance\nOnibaba (1964, Japan) - While not strictly a ghost story, it draws on demon-woman folklore\n\nJapanese vengeful spirits (onryō) typically arise from those who suffered injustice in life, especially women who experienced betrayal or violence.\nSoutheast Asian Ghost Traditions\nSoutheast Asian folk horror draws on rich regional ghost beliefs:\n\nThe Rites of May (1976, Philippines)\nSundelbolong (1981, Indonesia)\nPontianak Harum Sundal Malam (2004, Malaysia)\n\nThese films often feature female spirits tied to childbirth, maternal grief, or sexual violence.\nEuropean Ghost Traditions\nEuropean folk horror incorporates regional ghost folklore:\n\nDemon (2015, Poland) - Drawing on the dybbuk tradition from Jewish folklore\nLake of the Dead (1958, Norway) - Featuring Nordic ghost traditions\n\nLatin American Ghost Traditions\n\nLa Llorona (2019, Guatemala) - Reinterprets the widespread \"Weeping Woman\" legend through the context of Guatemala's genocide against indigenous peoples\n\nCommon Features\nDespite their cultural specificity, vengeful ghosts in folk horror often share certain characteristics:\nUnresolved Trauma\nThe spirits typically emerge from historical or personal traumas that have not been properly addressed or resolved.\nCultural Memory\nThey frequently embody aspects of collective memory or cultural history that mainstream narratives have attempted to suppress or forget.\nLiminal Existence\nThese ghosts often inhabit liminal spaces - thresholds between worlds, between life and death, between past and present.\nMoral Ambiguity\nUnlike in many mainstream horror films, vengeful ghosts in folk horror are frequently portrayed with moral ambiguity - victims as well as threats.\nPolitical Dimensions\nMany contemporary folk horror films use culturally-specific ghost traditions to address political themes:\nHistorical Justice\nVengeful ghosts often represent demands for historical justice or recognition of past atrocities.\nColonial Legacy\nIn many postcolonial contexts, vengeful spirits embody resistance to colonial narratives and the persistence of indigenous knowledge.\nGendered Violence\nFemale vengeful spirits frequently highlight issues of gendered violence and patriarchal oppression.\nExamples of Political Folk Horror Ghosts\nLa Llorona (2019, Guatemala) exemplifies the political potential of the vengeful ghost trope. Director Jayro Bustamante reimagines the traditional Weeping Woman as the spirit of an indigenous woman killed during Guatemala's civil war, haunting a former military general responsible for genocide. The film uses folk horror conventions to address historical trauma and the ongoing struggle for justice.\nSimilarly, the Thai film Rang Song (The Medium, 2021) uses traditional beliefs about spirit possession to explore intergenerational trauma and the tensions between traditional practices and modernity in northern Thailand.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring folk horror in cinema.

These traditions take different forms across cultures but share common themes of hidden knowledge, power derived from nature or spirits, and practices that exist outside mainstream religious institutions.\nWitchcraft in Folk Horror\nSurviving Traditions\nWitchcraft in folk horror is often treated as an ancient practice that has been carried on through the centuries, surviving despite modernization:\n\nThe City of the Dead (1960, UK)\nDon't Torture a Duckling (1972, Italy)\nAlison's Birthday (1981, Australia)\n\nThese films present witchcraft as something that has endured in secret, often in rural or isolated communities.\nResurrected Practices\nSome folk horror depicts witchcraft as something that has been resurrected from a time long gone:\n\nThe Wicker Man (1972, UK)\n\nIn these narratives, contemporary characters deliberately revive ancient practices, often as a rejection of modernity.\nPagan vs. Diabolical\nWitchcraft in folk horror is sometimes presented as part of a region's pagan past:\n\nLokis (1970, Poland)\nThe Juniper Tree (1990, Iceland)\nNovember (2017, Estonia)\n\nIn other films, it's explicitly framed as devil worship:\n\nHäxan (1922, Sweden)\nThe Witches (1966, UK)\nViy (1967, USSR)\nWitchfinder General (1968, UK)\nWitchhammer (1970, Czechoslovakia)\nHistory of the Occult (2020, Argentina)\n\nThis distinction often reflects historical attitudes toward folk beliefs, which were frequently reframed as satanic by religious authorities.\nThe Devil in Folk Horror\nFilms where the Devil literally appears differ from those focused on witchcraft:\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster (1941, US)\nSatan's Feats in the Village of Leva-e-Traz (1967, Brazil)\nBlood on Satan's Claw (1971, UK)\nNazareno Cruz and the Wolf (1975, Argentina)\nThe Legend of Hillbilly John (1974, US)\nBorn of Fire (1987, UK)\n\nShamanism\nShamanic practices appear in folk horror films from cultures with shamanic traditions:\n\nThe White Reindeer (1952, Finland)\nIo Island (1977, South Korea)\nThe Medium (2021, Thailand)\n\nThese films often explore the ambiguous role of shamans as mediators between human and spirit worlds, capable of both healing and harm.\nOther Forms of Folk Magic\nHoodoo and Rootwork\nAfrican diaspora traditions in the Americas:\n\nI Walked with a Zombie (1943, US)\nAngel Heart (1987, US)\nThe Serpent and the Rainbow (1988, US)\n\nThese films often mistakenly label these practices as \"voodoo,\" conflating distinct traditions.\nBrujeria\nLatin American magical traditions:\n\nThe Amulet of Ogum (1974, Brazil)\nVoodoo Black Exorcist (1974, Spain)\nThe Believers (1987, US)\n\nGender and Witchcraft\nFolk horror often reflects historical gender dynamics in its portrayal of witchcraft. Female practitioners are frequently depicted as either malevolent crones or seductive temptresses, reflecting centuries of misogynistic stereotypes about women with power. Male practitioners, by contrast, are more often portrayed as scholars or leaders.\nSome modern folk horror films have begun to subvert these dynamics, presenting witchcraft as a form of feminine empowerment against patriarchal oppression.\nHistorical Context\nThe witch trials of early modern Europe and colonial America cast a long shadow over folk horror's treatment of witchcraft. Films like Witchfinder General (1968, UK) and The Witch (2015, US) directly engage with this historical context, exploring how religious fear, gender politics, and social control intersected in the persecution of supposed witches.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring folk horror in cinema.

This creates a narrative in the shape of an X, with interesting implications for how we understand the film's commentary on economics during the Great Depression.\nBookending Images\nMy high school playwriting teacher once gave us an analytical exercise: take the first and last image of any film and demonstrate how those two images alone tell the story.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  The first shot after the credits\n\nThe film opens with a close-up on an oversized coin featuring a woman's profile—clearly a prop for the opening musical number \"We're in the Money.\" This number is promptly interrupted when police arrive to repossess everything, including the chorus girls' costumes.\n\n\n  \n\n  The final shot of the film\n\nIn contrast, the final shot shows Joan Blondell as a street sex worker surrounded by downtrodden people representing Depression-era suffering. Behind them, World War I soldiers appear in silhouette on arched platforms, with the theatre curtain barely visible at the top of the frame.\nThese bookending images might initially seem disconnected from the main plot, where three \"gold diggers\" (Polly, Carol, and Trixie) go from starving in a one-room apartment to marrying wealthy husbands. But this contrast is precisely the point.\n\nAs a result of the Depression, films in the first half of the 30s favored a hard-hitting, anti-establishment mood... only those antics of the monied class caricaturing them as willful, spoilt, manic and otherwise unsympathetic were accepted by moviegoers... this mood reached its climax with films like Public Enemy and Gold Diggers of 1933.\n—John Kobal, Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance p. 93-4\n\nNarrative in the Shape of an X\nThe film's structure creates a deliberate contrast:\n\nThe romance plot starts with poverty and ends with prosperity\nThe show-within-the-show begins with optimistic fantasy (\"We're in the Money\") and concludes with stark social realism (\"Remember My Forgotten Man\")\n\nThis contrapposto structure (borrowing from classical Greek sculpture, meaning \"counterpoise\") allows for delayed gratification. After the opening number is interrupted, viewers wait 35 minutes for another full musical sequence, as the film focuses on the struggle to fund the \"Forgotten Melody\" revue.\nWhen Plot Interrupts Music\nInstead of musical numbers interrupting the plot (as we often see in musicals), Gold Diggers of 1933 presents the opposite: the plot interrupts the music. This becomes literal in the film's third section when Lawrence's threat to Brad and Polly's romance delays the \"Forgotten Man\" finale.\nOnly when all romantic obstacles are overcome can the film conclude with the \"Forgotten Man\" number—a sequence that returns us to the economic realities of the Depression.\n\"Remember My Forgotten Man\"\n\nBerkeley's big numbers, generally sung by Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, or Joan Blondell, comprised one of the Hollywood musical's unique styles, instantly recognizable. Even more basic to these films, however, is the characteristic Warners political reading that shapes them. Gold Diggers of 1933 is suffused with Depression panic. Performing is work; one works to eat. And, lest we forget, the film closes with \"Remember My Forgotten Man,\" a Berkeley phantasmagoria on the socially disinherited war veteran.\n—Ethan Mordden, The Hollywood Studios p. 236\n\nThe finale serves as more than just a musical spectacle. Despite the romantic plot resolution, the film is \"suffused with Depression panic\" and closes with \"a Berkeley phantasmagoria on the socially disinherited war veteran.\"\n\n  &lt;  \n\n  Etta Moten performs her solo\nThe contrasting narratives comment on each other throughout. The finale isn't just about men who returned injured from WWI only to face bread lines during the Depression—it's also about women with even fewer options for economic stability. As Etta Moten sings, \"forgetting him, you see / means you're forgetting me.\"\nWhile it's entertaining to watch chorus girls manipulate wealthy men, the film's structure reminds us of the devastating consequences of America's inadequate social safety net. The gold digger and the street sex worker are two sides of the same big, flat, fake coin that opens the film—both strategies women employed to survive economic hardship.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nNote: This analysis was inspired by a film teaching exercise where students examine how a film's opening and closing images can reveal its narrative and thematic structure.\n","description":"Plot in the shape of an X.","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/gold-diggers-1933/","path":"/notes/gold-diggers-1933/","title":"Gold Diggers of 1933: Narrative Structure"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/inside-out/":{"body":"📺 I make this joke a lot but still: this is what they took from us!!\nIt's not just seeing tits onscreen every 4 minutes (although let's be real, we were spoiled by movie boobs in this era). 90s softcore was all about sensuality and the mysterious interiority of femmes. Paint circling a nipple, lips being licked, a shot of lingerie being smoothed over soft skin… women were delicate and needy creatures, \"masterpieces\" as more than one of these short films argues. If hardcore porn is all about the money shot—incontrovertible proof of a man's orgasm—softcore in this era hinged wholly on impossible-to-confirm, luscious, drawn out femme pleasure.\nThe Segments\nIn Lizzie Borden's way-too-short first segment, a female therapist records her patient's sexual fantasies and then acts them out for herself. Or at least dresses up like she's going to? This one feels like the first act of a longer story but it cuts off frustratingly before events actually get going.\nThe segment by Linda Hassani (who directed Dark Angel: The Ascent, a straight-to-VHS movie I adore) is about a prisoner using astral projection to find out if his wife has been cheating while he's been locked up. She hasn't been—she's too busy masturbating while staring at his picture. Nevertheless things go badly, in a Twilight Zone sort of way.\nBorden has another segment that she both wrote and directed, this one about a woman whose husband is sexually bored with her, and so stages a series of escalating encounters between her and other men.\n\nThe interstitials are highkey Vertigo Comics aesthetics and I yelled every single time a Paul Valéry or Ben Jonson quote popped up to frame the next short film.

It was stitched together from two different prints intended for two different markets.\nPlot Synopsis\nHere's how a movie magazine summarized the film's plot in 1921:\n\nMa Birdsong, her son Jimmie, and her daughter Essie live together in New York City's East Side. Essie, enamored with the city's night life, becomes an usherette in a cheap theater where she falls in love with Joe Ullman, a crooked ticket speculator. Her ailing mother repeatedly asks to meet Essie's fiancé, but Joe always has a ready excuse to decline. Following a heart attack, Ma makes another plea to meet Joe. Essie finds him in a poolroom, but he scornfully refuses to accompany her. In desperation, Essie relates her story to a stranger; he agrees to pose as the girl's fiancé for the sake of her mother. Ma Birdsong dies, secure in the thought that Essie is to marry \"a real man.\" Essie later falls in love with the stranger and they marry.\n\nFrances Marion's Directorial Debut\nFrances Marion wrote and directed this Fannie Hurst adaptation, after having written the adaptation of Hurst's Humoresque the previous year. That film was directed by Frank Borzage, who was originally set to direct this one as well, according to the AFI's movie magazine research. Instead Marion took over, making this her directorial debut. She would go on to direct two more films, The Love Light (1921) and The Song of Love (1923).\nJust Around the Corner, based on a short story titled \"The Superman,\" is a Fannie Hurst tale through and through—the story of working poor New Yorkers crowded into a tenement, struggling to lead lives that matter, with family tragedy just around the corner.\n\nWomen's Labor and Exploitation\nThe hat shop scene early on is a fascinating representation of women's material labor at the time (and maybe a nod to Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth?). Hurst and Marion are bold in their pro-labor feminist politics, deftly showing-not-telling that bosses exploit both women's labor and their bodies, and that poor women are forced to accept both the illegal working conditions and the sexual assault because they need money to survive.\nIronically, when Essie wants to take a job as a theatre usher for better pay, her mother and brother object because of the job's connotations of prostitution. \"It's night work!\" Ma Birdsong exclaims. As though Essie wasn't already getting her breasts groped by her aggressive sweatshop boss!\nMelodrama and Pacing\nThe film starts to drag a bit as it shifts into full melodrama mode, pairing Essie off with a bad beau who keeps dodging her attempts to bring him home to meet her family. Despite her anti-sex work stance, the sight of Ma Birdsong waiting endlessly at the set dinner table, adjusting the silverware again and again, broke my heart. Unfortunately, the story moves slowly and predictably in this section, really sucking the energy out of things.\nThe pace picks up somewhat towards the end thanks to the intervention of a big sweet hunk, played by Marion's real-life husband and literally credited as \"The Real Man,\" who arrives just in time to do a whole heap of emotional labor and teach everybody a lesson about non-toxic masculinity. Even in 1921 we loved a deus ex himbo.\nPreservation Status\nJust Around the Corner is held in the Library of Congress, but is not available for home viewing. Sigrid Holmquist, called \"the Mary Pickford of Sweden,\" made her American film debut in this movie. The restoration work that made this screening possible highlights the ongoing importance of film preservation, especially for works by early women directors.\n{{ divider(simple) }}\nThis note is part of my exploration of early women filmmakers.\n","description":"On Frances Marion's 1921 film, from a Fannie Hurst story about working-class women in NYC.","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/just-around-the-corner/","path":"/notes/just-around-the-corner/","title":"Just Around the Corner: Frances Marion's Directorial Debut"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/meet-me-in-st-louis/":{"body":"I finally saw Meet Me in St. Louis and it was not what I expected.

These devices exploited a phenomenon known as \"apparent motion\" to create the illusion of continuous motion from a series of static images.\nCommon Optical Toys\nMagic Lantern\nThe magic lantern used light shined through transparent colored material to project images onto a surface. While not technically an animation device in its basic form, more advanced versions used movable glass slides to create simple animations. It also became the foundation for optical toys and moving pictures that projected their images on a surface.\nPhénakisticope (1832)\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nInvented by Joseph Plateau, the phénakisticope consisted of a disc with slits and a succession of images. When the disc was spun and the viewer looked through the slits into a mirror, the succession of images appeared to merge into a single moving image—an early demonstration of apparent motion.\nZoetrope (1834)\nThe zoetrope operated on the same principle as the phénakisticope but removed the need for a mirror. Viewers looked through slits in a rotating cylinder at images arranged around the inside wall. This made the viewing experience more accessible and could be enjoyed by multiple viewers simultaneously.\nKinematoscope (1861)\nThe kinematoscope had viewers look through slits at images on the blades of a rotating paddle, which was operated by a hand crank. This variation helped to refine the timing mechanics that would later be important for film projection.\nPraxinoscope (1877)\nÉmile Reynaud improved on the zoetrope by using a set of mirrors to reflect the image, eliminating the need for slits. This innovation significantly brightened the image and reduced the flickering effect, creating a smoother viewing experience.\nZoopraxiscope (1879)\nEadweard Muybridge's zoopraxiscope combined the principles of the magic lantern and the phénakisticope to project a succession of images from a spinning glass disc. This device represents a significant step toward modern film projection.\nMuybridge used the zoopraxiscope to display his motion studies of animals and humans. Because the zoopraxiscope caused image distortion when projected, the photographs had to be recreated as illustrations that compensated for this foreshortening effect.\nEducational Value\nI first encountered optical toys through a colleague who had a collection of reproductions used for teaching film history. Watching students interact with these devices creates a tangible connection to the technological principles underlying cinema. The hands-on experience of manipulating a zoetrope or praxinoscope helps students understand the persistence of vision phenomenon in a way that digital demonstrations cannot replicate.\nThese seemingly simple toys demonstrate the fundamental principles that would eventually lead to cinema: the breaking down of motion into discrete frames and the rapid presentation of those frames to create the illusion of continuous movement.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring the pre-history of cinema.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/optical-toys/","path":"/notes/optical-toys/","title":"Optical Toys: Early Animation Technologies"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/owning-my-data/":{"body":"One project I have been working on slowly over the past couple of years is \"owning my own data\"—in other words, making sure that I have local &amp; backed up copies of the stuff I post to the internet.

It sounds like a simple question, but the answer is surprisingly slippery. We could start in December of 1895 when the Lumière brothers presented what was likely the first commercial film screening. Or we could start in late 1894 when W.K.L. Dickson shot The Dickson Experimental Sound Film, creating what was likely the first film with synchronized sound. But we could also start as early as 1888 when Louis Le Prince used a single-lens camera and paper film to create the Roundhay Garden Scene, or in 1878 when Eadweard Muybridge shot his first motion studies, or even in 1874 when Jules Janssen tested if his \"photographic revolver\" could capture the transit of Venus across the sun.\nIn reality, \"new\" technologies don't emerge fully formed in a singular historic moment; they are always the result of numerous previous developments. The process is iterative.\nIt's no different with cinema: centuries of technological innovation led, eventually, to the invention of moving pictures. These innovations can be grouped into three main categories:\n\nOptical toys that created the illusion of movement\nAdvances in photography that allowed for capturing moments in time\nSound recording technologies that developed in parallel\n\nBy the late 1880s, all of the major components necessary for the invention of moving pictures were in place, ready to be combined into what we now recognize as cinema.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring the pre-history of cinema.

It holds the tangible proof that another world is not only possible but already being built, one student project at a time.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  This watercolor and linocut approximation was created using Adobe's text-to-image generator with the prompt \"garden where computers grow.\" It captures the essence of both botanical abundance and technological resilience that solarpunk embodies. Where plants and computing power intertwine, we find a practical metaphor for building regenerative digital infrastructure within living systems.\n\nSolarpunk as Generative Practice\n\n\"Solarpunk is about finding ways to make life more wonderful for us right now, and more importantly for the generations that follow us—i.e., extending human life at the species level, rather than individually. Our future must involve repurposing and creating new things from what we already have (instead of 20th century 'destroy it all and build something completely different' modernism). Our futurism is not nihilistic... it is about ingenuity, generativity... and community.\"\n—Adam Flynn, \"Solarpunk: Notes toward a manifesto\"\n\nThis is what we practiced in class: critical making as a form of applied anarchist theory. Students also kept \"field journals for a low-carbon future,\" with the rule being that they had to use something they already had at hand or make something from recycled supplies. Field journals became sites for documenting our experiments with degrowth living. The off-grid intranet was our answer to the question: what happens to digital community when the power goes out?\nThese weren't just academic exercises; they were working prototypes exploring what life and communication might look like when centralized infrastructure fails.\nCritical Making as Solarpunk Praxis\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Another AI-generated vision from the prompt \"garden where computers grow\"—this time with \"layered paper\" as a style prompt. The scattered pages on the ground suggest autumn maintenance, while the turquoise sky and coral blooms create an optimistic palette that speaks to the harmony between digital tools and natural ecosystems that solarpunk envisions.\n\nTeaching solarpunk means bridging my interests in anarchist theory, nature, and technology. We begin with imagining better futures, and then we practice building them at whatever scale we can. Next semester's class on digital infrastructure and climate change continues this thread of my teaching. When my new students hold the prototypes my former students built, they'll understand that solarpunk isn't just an aesthetic—it's about making things that might actually keep us connected when systems fail.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nFuture Directions: Speculative Fiction as Blueprint\nI've been thinking about eventually developing a science fiction course that would explore solarpunk through storytelling and worldbuilding. HydroponicTrash's description resonates with this direction:\n\n\"At the moment, we are in the global struggle against capitalism, hierarchy, and domination. But it's interesting to read a story about how people made it through, and built a better future around some of the topics and ideas here. It makes it easier to walk in someone else's shoes so to speak and imagine yourself say in a democratic confederalist assembly of your community, voicing your opinion on a community action to help preserve endangered wildlife in your area. Or speculating what a degrowth future might look like where we lower our energy demand by creating free and open housing that is passive, and heats and cools itself, and how you might interact in an upcycled and revamped suburb with sprawling public transport that runs off low resource intensive passive solar. These things can be worked out, speculated, and shown as both a fiction, but also a path forward to imagine what the world could look like.\"\n—HydroponicTrash, \"The Good Life: Buen Vivir, Hygge, Solarpunk &amp; Degrowth\"\n\nThis connects to my growing interest in more-than-human kin networks. Maria Puig de la Bellacasa's book Matters of Care: Speculative Ethics in More Than Human Worlds offers a framework that might combine beautifully with solarpunk storytelling—exploring not just how humans might live differently, but how we might reimagine our relationships with all beings in the Anthropocene.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note connects to my explorations of digital gardens and commonplace books.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/solarpunk/","path":"/notes/solarpunk/","title":"Solarpunk Futures"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/streaming-cinema-quality/":{"body":"\"Tide Pod cinema\" is a delightfully bitchy phrase coined by Will Tavlin in his otherwise frustrating essay \"Casual Viewing\". I think it describes something important about contemporary streaming cinema—content that appears colorful and attractive but is poisonous to a healthy film culture.\nTavlin uses the phrase to describe Netflix's output of \"movies that go down best when you're not paying attention\" or films made \"to half-watch while doing laundry.\" The term cleverly captures several qualities of streaming-exclusive films:\n\n\nAlgorithmic Optimization: Movies that feel designed to satisfy platform metrics instead of artistic vision\n\n\nDisposability: Content clearly created with no expectation it will be remembered or revisited in a year\n\n\nSuperficial Engagement: Films that prioritize immediate visual appeal over any substantive ideas\n\n\nFormulaic Structures: Stories so predictable you could write the ending after the first five minutes\n\n\nAvoiding Ahistorical Critiques\nWhile I think the \"Tide Pod cinema\" critique identifies something real, we should avoid nostalgic misconceptions that come with it. Studio-era Hollywood wasn't a golden age where every film was Casablanca or Citizen Kane. As I pointed out in my note on the history of film subscription models, the ratio of forgettable films to classics has always been high.\nSimilarly, the notion that theatrical viewing was historically some reverent, distraction-free experience simply isn't true. People talked, ate, entered mid-film, and generally treated movie theaters as social spaces rather than temples of cinematic appreciation. (And that's not even mentioning porn theatres...)\nMore Productive Criticism\nI think there are more interesting angles to explore when critiquing streaming content:\n\n\nCreative Control: How do algorithmic recommendations and data-driven development potentially limit artistic risk-taking?\n\n\nPreservation Issues: What happens to streaming-exclusive films when platforms decide they're no longer worth hosting?\n\n\nEconomic Models: How does creator compensation in streaming differ from traditional models, and what does that mean for the kinds of stories that get told?\n\n\nQuestions I'm Still Pondering\n\n\nHow can we develop critical frameworks that acknowledge both continuity and change in media production?\n\n\nWhat do we do with Ethan Mordden's claim that intense demand for product led to creative innovation during the studio system? Could we make the same claim about streaming?\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nI'd like to explore these questions further, perhaps in connection with how physical media constraints have historically influenced both film and television production. The transition from physical to digital distribution may be as significant as the shift from stage to screen was in the early 20th century.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/streaming-cinema-quality/","path":"/notes/streaming-cinema-quality/","title":"The Quality Question in Streaming Cinema"},"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/villages-folk-horror/":{"body":"I recently designed a course on genre in film. The theme for the first iteration of the class is folk horror—a genre where villages frequently appear as both settings and symbolic spaces where forgotten traditions persist.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  A village green in rural England, watercolor and linocut-style illustration created with Adobe text-to-image. The open communal space surrounded by cottages represents the traditional commons that were central to village life before the enclosure movement.\n\nWhat Is a Village?\nIn the UK, where folk horror came into its own, a village is a compact settlement of houses with a public building like a church, often sited for agriculture. Medieval villages were usually organized around a village green and land would have been farmed communally. This is where the phrase \"the commons\" comes from—a common place, both physically and conceptually, that belonged to everyone.\nThe concept of the \"village green\" as a common place mirrors the idea of a \"commonplace book\"—a personal collection of important ideas, quotes, and knowledge gathered in one location. Both represent shared repositories of community wisdom, whether physical (the green) or textual (the commonplace book).\nUnfortunately, after the 1600s, the commons were enclosed and private property became the organizing principle of farming and life:\n\nOne of the major changes that led to the increased complexity in the form of the British village was the movement away from communal open-field farming (common in medieval times) to the enclosure of land into regular fields which occurred in most of Britain between 1600 and 1800. This had a huge effect on settlements as new patterns of farm holdings developed away from the village centre. In many cases the village structure was weakened as the farming population moved away from the centres of population.\n—Greg Stevenson\n\nVillages in Folk Horror\nIn folk horror, villages often function as:\nTime Capsules\nThe village frequently represents a space where time has moved differently, preserving beliefs and practices that have been abandoned by urban society:\n\nThe Wicker Man (1973, UK)\nChildren of the Corn (1984, US)\nApostle (2018, UK)\n\nCommunities of Shared Knowledge\nVillages maintain collective memories and communal traditions that can be both protective and dangerous:\n\nThe White Reindeer (1952, Finland)\nThe Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978, US)\nMidsommar (2019, US/Sweden)\n\nContested Spaces\nMany folk horror films explore the tension between communal traditions (the commons) and more modern, individualistic values:\n\nWitchfinder General (1968, UK)\nThe Medium (2021, Thailand)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThe Lost Commons\nThe concept of \"the commons\" is particularly significant in folk horror. The enclosure movement of the 16th-18th centuries in Britain transformed communal land into private property, fundamentally changing rural social structures.\nThe Diggers, a 17th-century radical Protestant group, resisted these enclosures by establishing communes on unused land. Their defense of the commons could be seen as an early form of agrarian anarchism—a resistance to the privatization that was destroying communal life in favor of capitalism.\nFolk horror often mourns or examines this loss of communal living while simultaneously expressing anxiety about the darker aspects of tight-knit communities. The village becomes both utopian and dystopian—a space where people care for each other collectively, but also where conformity is enforced through tradition and ritual.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis note is part of a series exploring folk horror in cinema. I'm developing these themes for a film genre course focusing on folk horror.\n","description":"","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/notes/villages-folk-horror/","path":"/notes/villages-folk-horror/","title":"Villages in Folk Horror: The Lost Commons"},"https://nonmodernist.com/reading/":{"body":"I've been keeping track of the books I read since the early 2000s, but pre-1999 is incomplete.

We’ll ask questions like:\n\nWhat can Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino teach us about the male gaze and the panopticon?\nDoes a documentary about queer black and Latino ballroom culture help us understand why Judith Butler called gender performative?\nHow do gender, race, class, and national identity intersect in horror films? In Oscar-winning dramas? In the brief ethnographic films of Zora Neale Hurston?\nHow have indigenous women filmmakers worked to decolonize the film industry?\nWhat do bell hooks and an imaginary movie star have in common?\n\nOur class meetings will include discussions, breaks to recharge, and screenings of all required films; students are encouraged to bring their own snacks or meals for a movie bistro-style experience. I take seriously the feminist insistence that we are both our minds and our bodies—you can’t learn when you’re hungry or exhausted. So even though our class is a long block of time, we’ll mix it up and keep it moving and hopefully have fun digging into the writing and filmmaking work of feminist, queer, decolonial and anti-colonial thinkers.\nMy wildest dream for this course is to recreate the magic of 1970s feminist film festivals, 90s riot grrrl scenes, and the contemporary queer feminist collective Club des Femmes. So I’ve tried to create a class that is less like a stuffy academic space and more like an exciting, generative, and inspiring hangout spot where we watch, think, talk, and write together. We’ll create weekly responses to the course material, film introductions, and a collaborative film zine.\nAssignments and Prompts\n\nReading and Viewing List\nCollaborative Zine\n\n","description":"ENGL 30803","id":"https://nonmodernist.com/teaching/engl30803/","path":"/teaching/engl30803/","title":"Theories of Cinema: Women, Cinema, Nation"},"https://nonmodernist.com/teaching/philosophy/":{"body":"✨\nIn my campus office, I keep an archive of my students’ work. It’s not just a filing cabinet stuffed with papers; it’s more like a gallery collection displayed all around me, and it grows each year.\nOn one wall, large posters describe the careers of Anita Loos, Vera Caspary, and Edna Ferber, and on a ledge nearby, a 3D-printed model of a 1950s film camera is accompanied by a tag explaining that this model camera was used to film the Ferber adaptation Giant. My bookshelves are filled with students’ handmade accordion books containing hand-drawn data visualizations.\nThere’s also a board game about student debt, a 100-page feminist film theory mega-zine, and a plastic box that contains the components and instructions for assembling an emergency off-grid intranet that can be used to share information during natural disasters. I never design a class without considering what I can invite my students to make next.\nI model my classroom on the cultural networks I research—for example, the transformative fan communities and creators that I wrote about in my first book. Transformative fandom lives in spaces of possibility, where the smallest detail of a text can become a window into a new universe. My students and I crawl through such windows together: conducting stealth missions into the landscapes of film and literature, gleaning insights and resistances, and bringing them back to our campus and our lives to be shared, and, ultimately, transformed.\nIn past years, those windows have taken us into the history of Hollywood film adaptation, where my students have been hunting for lost films and forgotten women writers. This research and writing project turns students loose with the goal of recovering as much information as possible about one film adapted from the work of an American woman writer. In the process, students have a chance to design a research question, practice broadly transferable research and writing skills, and contribute their recovered knowledge to the public commons through platforms like Wikipedia, hand-coded web archives, and on-campus exhibitions.\nSometimes, they stumble onto mysteries that would flummox even the hardest-boiled film detective and end up writing blog posts with titles like, “Sylvia Tate: Does She Even Exist?”\nStudents are thrilled by the prospect of writing to expand or transform public knowledge, because it makes their effort and experiences reverberate beyond the walls of the classroom. As one of my students wrote in a reflection essay:\n\nFor the first time, I felt like a course had a greater purpose that went far beyond what was on the syllabus. When I learned that we would be editing Wikipedia pages, I thought to myself, ‘Why is my professor so excited about this?’\nI later realized that we were slowly adding to and changing something greater than us. We were shining a light back onto the lives and stories of forgotten female authors and screenwriters who helped change the film industry. By adding those Wikipedia pages, we were sharing their stories and making sure they were not forgotten…\nAlthough the 300 words I added did not seem like much, it was reassuring to know that people after me will add to what I contributed and together we will rewrite the story of some amazing female authors.\n\nValuing student labor in and beyond the classroom is a central tenet of my pedagogy; the “work” of “transformative works” is just as important as the “transformative.”\nThis means that students themselves often get to define what they want to create and how they’ll go about it, which ensures that they have the chance to use their existing skillsets and to connect their work to their other courses and interests. To conclude such self-directed projects, I ask students to write up detailed self-assessments that help them articulate their strengths and consider how they might improve upon their weaknesses in the future.\nSeveral of my students have gone on to win competitive scholarships and join distinguished graduate programs, but more importantly to me, all of them have had a chance to see their writing matter in the context of a global scholarly conversation about literature, media, and culture. They have updated hundreds of Wikipedia articles and made connections with scholars and local historians across the country.\nTheir research has also inspired and assisted my work outside the classroom; Feminist Media Histories published my article based on the research of nine of my students into the film adaptations of Gene Stratton-Porter. Seeing their names in print was among my proudest moments as an educator.\nPracticing a pedagogy of transformative works also helps me to intentionally align my teaching with the “transformative pedagogy” of teacher-scholars around the world who build on the critical pedagogy of Paolo Friere and the transgressive, engaged pedagogy of bell hooks.\nMy commitment to transformation as classroom methodology is a commitment to the transformation of our entire world—a commitment to build something, not just for my students, but side by side with them.\n","description":"My teaching
