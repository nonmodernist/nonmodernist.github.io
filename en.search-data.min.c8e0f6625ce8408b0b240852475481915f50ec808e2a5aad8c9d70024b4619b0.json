Why should we examine these categories through cinema?\nIn the field of literary studies, \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; is all about playing with words, phrases, definitions\u0026ndash;turning things around and looking at them from unexpected angles, unsettling our own expectations through language.

One of the worst things about the arbitrary form of authority we see in the classroom is the way it makes us lose our trust in the possibility of learning from people who know what they‚Äôre doing and could share their wisdom with us. When they make you obey a cruel and unreasonable teacher, they can curtail your desire to learn from a kind and reasonable wise person. When they order you to pick up after yourselves in the cafeteria, they can undermine your own freely-occurring sense of courtesy. Imagine a room full of screaming people: truly, it is much easier if they quiet themselves than it is to forcibly quiet them. The way that today‚Äôs schools insist on the latter inhibits people from developing the ability to be quiet and attentive on their own.\n‚ÄîCrimethinc\nIn this course, I invite you to define and pursue your own goals. Obviously this is not a fully anarchist or autonomous space‚Äîyou and I both must still meet the requirements of the university. Thus, your learning goals will need in some way to be related to our class, as it is defined by the registrar. But within that framework, and acknowledging that the framework itself is an ‚Äúarbitrary form of authority,‚Äù my goal is force open the space for you to engage with learning in ways that interest and thrill you.\nTo help us build this space together, first I need to know you, your interests, and your goals. Please type an informal letter to me (it should be about 700 words) first introducing yourself (your nickname or preferred name, your pronouns, where you‚Äôre from, major, interests, etc., and other fun details you want to share), describing your history as a reader of nonfiction or just as a student, and sharing some goals for what‚Äôs ahead.\nBelow are some questions to help guide you (you are not expected to answer all of these; pick a few from the list that most apply to you).¬†At the end of your letter to me, let me know if you have any questions regarding the syllabus or anything discussed in our first class.¬†Then please write a final statement letting me know that you have read and understand the course syllabus and sign the letter.¬†Prompts # What kind of reading do you primarily do now (think beyond traditional reading to things like Twitter, Instagram, email, blogging, websites, texting, IM, etc.)? What do you think are your main strengths as a student? Why do you think so? What do you think are your main challenges as a student? Why do you think so? What type of learning (again, think beyond traditional learning in school) have you always liked doing? Disliked? Why? Who has influenced what you‚Äôre interested in learning (in either a negative or positive way)? How do you use technology when you learn (for example, using and sharing photos or visuals, composing online, etc.)? How comfortable are you with the technology you use for learning? What strategies or process do you use when you read and where did you learn them? Do you use the same strategies for anything you read, or do they differ depending on what/whom you‚Äôre reading for? What are these differences? Do you always read on a computer/tablet/phone? What do you find most difficult about learning? What makes learning easy (or less difficult) for you? If you could change one thing about yourself as a student, what would it be? What goals do you have for your learning this semester? Feel free to be as practical or as whimsical as you like. How will you remind yourself of these goals? How will you know when you‚Äôve achieved your goals? What other personal or academic goals do you have for this semester? For your time in college? How could you use this class to achieve them?

The determining male gaze projects its fantasy onto the female figure, which is styled accordingly. In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness.\n\u0026ndash;Laura Mulvey, \u0026ldquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\u0026rdquo;\nMen survey women before treating them. Consequently how a woman appears to a man can determine how she will be treated. To acquire some control over this process, women must contain it and interiorize it.\n\u0026ndash;John Berger, Ways of Seeing p. 46\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s the 1970s and a new feminist movement is popping off. But while previous generations of feminists had been concerned with political representation (the right to vote), the academic turn towards psychoanalytic theory meant that many 70s feminists were concerned with symbolic representation, while the burgeoning field of critical theory pushed feminists to think about ideological representation. Both theoretical frameworks focused on cultural products (like narrative films) and the ways they shape the world.\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s readings demonstrate the differences and similarities between psychoanalytic and critical theory, while also setting the stage for our work this semester. John Berger\u0026rsquo;s Ways of Seeing emerges from critical theory, which has a decidedly Marxist focus; in other words, critical theory is concerned with power structures, especially class as a tool of oppression. Laura Mulvey\u0026rsquo;s essay, on the other hand, takes the psychoanalytic approach.\nBerger and Mulvey, following Jean-Paul Sartre, brought the concept of the \u0026ldquo;male gaze\u0026rdquo; into the mainstream, but from the earliest days of film, the gaze was being depicted and theorized by filmmakers, especially women.\nWe see this especially in Dance, Girl, Dance, which Claire Johnston noticed in the 1970s:\nTowards the end of the film Arzner brings about her tour de force, cracking open the entire fabric of the film and exposing the workings of ideology in the construction of the stereotype of woman. Judy, in a fit of anger, turns on her audience and tells them how she sees them. This return of scrutiny in what within the film is assumed as a one-way process constitutes a direct assault on the audience within the film and the audience of the film, and has the effect of directly challenging the entire notion a woman as spectacle.\n\u0026ndash;Claire Johnston, \u0026ldquo;Women\u0026rsquo;s Cinema as Counter-Cinema\u0026rdquo;\nBut this climactic tour de force works because Arzner (along with story writer Vicki Baum) has developed the gaze (or gazes) as a foundational theme of her film; looks and looking are important throughout the movie.\nAfter discussing this week\u0026rsquo;s readings and watching Dance, Girl, Dance in class, create a response to the following questions:\nWhat shots and/or scenes before Judy\u0026rsquo;s speech make us aware of \u0026ldquo;the male gaze\u0026rdquo;? Are there other types of gazes that Arzner includes? How are each of these represented visually? How do Bubbles and Judy respond to men looking at them throughout the film? How do they look back at the men and/or at each other?

Researching historical penal systems led Foucault to argue that the shift from public executions to imprisonment represented a new and different relationship between people and power\u0026ndash;especially the power of institutions. As we‚Äôll read this week, he wrote about an architectural form, the Panopticon: a prison in which all prisoners can be surveilled at any time. The threat of constantly being seen, Foucault argued, led prisoners to discipline themselves, effectively imposing the punishment of the state upon themselves.\nAfter discussing this week\u0026rsquo;s reading and watching The Hitch-Hiker in class, respond to the following prompts:\nWhat elements of the film demonstrate what Foucault and others have called \u0026ldquo;carceral society\u0026rdquo;? Here you might think about the plot of the film, but also the settings, characters, themes, visual motifs, props, sound‚Äîeven the car our main characters drive.

Carol Clover looked to horror films, especially slashers, which had become popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Clover argued that because these films were formulaic, crude, and targeted at teen boys, they were a compelling place to analyze gendered representations and the complexities of the cinematic gaze. While slasher films might at first glance seem purely misogynistic, Clover urges us to read the camerawork, plot, and tropes of these films\u0026ndash;especially the character type of the final girl\u0026ndash;as more complicated than that.\nWhat filmmakers seem to know better than film critics is that gender is less a wall than a permeable membrane.\n\u0026ndash;Carol Clover, Men, Women, and Chainsaws\nThe gender-identity game, in short, is too patterned and too pervasive in the slasher film to be dismissed‚Ä¶ It would seem instead to be an integral element of the particular brand of bodily sensation in which the genre trades.\n\u0026ndash;Carol Clover, Men, Women, and Chainsaws\nClover pays close attention to the first-person camera work of slasher films and a later chapter of her book is dedicated entirely to eyes in horror films. Last week we watched The Hitch-hiker, in which the never-closed eye of a killer generates fear and dread in both the characters and the audience. Our theorists thus far have prompted us to think about the gaze as a kind of power. With all of this in mind, respond to one of the following prompts:\nIs the threatening gaze of the slasher film the same as the surveilling gaze of the panopticon? Why or why not? If the act of looking confers power on the one who looks, how can we map issues of gender onto the varied looks and gender expressions of the slasher film? Does the \u0026ldquo;gender play\u0026rdquo; that Clover describes complicate or clarify our expected ideas of the relationship between gender and power? Clover is very set on describing gender in binary terms (a notable weakness of 70s and 80s feminist theory). What, if any, is the relationship between the slasher film and non-binary gender identity?

Thus one way to understand a difficult reading like Judith Butler is to figure out what \u0026ldquo;if, then\u0026rdquo; is being tested out and evaluated.\nEarly on in Gender Trouble, Butler suggests that if we cannot escape \u0026ldquo;juridical structures of language and politics,\u0026rdquo; then we need to figure out how to critique \u0026ldquo;the categories of identity\u0026rdquo; that such structures create/reinforce (5). She is concerned especially with the political category of \u0026ldquo;woman,\u0026rdquo; and whether or not it is as stable as feminists at the time claimed. Indeed, later she directly writes her own \u0026ldquo;if, then\u0026rdquo; statement: \u0026ldquo;If gender is constructed, could it be constructed differently, or does its constructedness imply some form of social determinism, foreclosing the possibility of agency and transformation?\u0026rdquo; (7). This is the question she spends the rest of her book thinking through.\nWith this in mind, create a response to the following questions:\nHow is gender constructed in Beau Travail? Is it different for characters based on their race or national origin? Does the film suggest that gender could be constructed differently, or is gender a form of social determinism without agency?

Course Description # When you hear the word ‚Äúanarchy,‚Äù you might think of chaos, disorder, even violence. And yet, as a political philosophy, anarchism opposes violence, promotes utopian ways of thinking, and inspires remarkably cogent and inspiring pieces of writing. How can we understand these seeming contradictions? Is there more to anarchism than chaos?\nIn this survey-style course, we will read, watch, and listen to anarchist (and anarchist-adjacent) nonfiction from a variety of genres, including memoir, reportage, manifesto, oratory, documentary, and more, with a goal of understanding how anarchist nonfiction has influenced and been influenced by culture, society, and individuals throughout history. We‚Äôll explore threads that range from 16th and 17th-century European Christian Anarchism to 21st-century indigenous guerrillas operating an autonomous society in Mexico. We‚Äôll apply a variety of critical approaches to these texts as we practice analyzing literary genre.\nSince anarchism rejects hierarchies and is skeptical of authority, we will spend the semester investigating and resisting the forms of hierarchy and authority all around us, including how college classes are ‚Äúusually‚Äù conducted. While I am, to the university, the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù at the front of the room, in practice I will strive to be a facilitator for your self-directed learning. For more about what this means on a practical level, see the section on ‚ÄúAssignments and (un)Grading.‚Äù\nAssignments and (un)Grading # Reading List Statement of Goals -Collaborative Mutual Aid Project Proposal Midterm Self-Assessment Final Self-Assessment What is Ungrading and Why is It a Thing? # üìñ This explanation is adapted from Monica Heilman. I have revised it to better reflect my values. In this class, we‚Äôre going to ‚Äúungrade.‚Äù At the most basic level, ungrading is the idea of not assessing students with grades. In an ideal world, students would only take a class because they are motivated to learn. Grades and assessment wouldn‚Äôt matter, because the important thing would be whether you understand the material well enough to be enriched by it.\nIn reality, students take plenty of classes to fulfill degree requirements, meet a required number of credit hours, and graduate. Grades are required for a degree and high grades may be required for scholarships, grants, and graduate and professional degrees.\nThis focus on grades produces a problem. Researchers have found that grades might motivate students to seek high grades but do not necessarily motivate them to learn. The A to F system itself was not designed with student learning in mind but intended to streamline the grading process.\nLetter grades and numerical points don‚Äôt communicate much information. As you know by now, what is required to get an ‚ÄúA‚Äù in one professor‚Äôs class can be completely different from another‚Äôs. Context also changes how we view grades. Which one seems more impressive: getting an ‚ÄúA‚Äù in an advanced physics class with a private tutor, or an ‚ÄúA‚Äù in a first-year history class while working full-time and managing a disruptive illness? For your GPA, these two A‚Äôs might be weighted equally, but you know that the work you put in for each class was not.\nSo we know that grades were not designed to improve student learning, do not motivate learning, and do not actually communicate as much information as we might think. Experts have identified even others reasons too; if you‚Äôre interested in reading more, Alfie Kohn‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Case Against Grades‚Äù covers a lot of ground.\nUngrading in Our Class: Self-Reflection # While there are many forms of ungrading ‚Äì and modified grading practices that get at the concerns above ‚Äì I‚Äôll focus on the form we‚Äôll use in our class. I draw primarily on Jesse Stommel‚Äôs model of ungrading, which uses student self-reflection.\nStommel emphasizes self-reflection as a way of teaching metacognition, or an awareness of your own mental processes. In this case, we‚Äôre talking about an awareness of your learning. As experts in their course material, faculty can assess your output in a class (i.e. discussion comments, written work, exams). Yet output doesn‚Äôt always give a clear picture of learning. Maybe you have bad test anxiety, or you struggle with writing. Regardless of how well you produce output, you are the only one fully aware of your knowledge; after all, no one else can see inside your head but you. Improving your metacognition skills will help you think more consciously about your learning and become better at assessing your own performance.\nBut let‚Äôs bring it back down to this semester.\nWhile you will propose your grade in one final reflection letter, self-reflection will be an on-going part of the course. There will be opportunities for self-reflection within your class discussions, your writing assignments, your midterm reflection letter, and in your final project. And, at the end of the semester, I will reserve the right to assign you a final grade that takes into account the learning and effort I have seen you demonstrate‚Äîwhether that is lower or higher than the grade you propose for yourself. But don‚Äôt worry too much about that now; by the end of the semester, we will have built a rapport and trust that makes this caveat much less scary than it may be now, when you don‚Äôt know me at all. As I said in the course description, I will strive to be the facilitator for your self-directed learning.\nInstructor Role # Although self-reflection is a significant part of the course, this does not mean you will not have support. As your instructor, I will provide qualitative feedback on your classwork. Since we are using a system of ungrading, I will not be assigning points or letter grades to any individual assignments. However, I will provide substantive feedback on your work through individual comments.\nIn sum, you will:\nComplete reading and assignments regularly throughout the semester Direct your own learning, including articulating your goals and assessing your progress Propose your final grade for the course I will:\nComment on your discussion posts regularly Provide written feedback on your writing assignments, midterm letter, and final project Provide individual written and/or group verbal feedback on exams I will not:\nProvide points or letter grades on assignments Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion # A diversity of experience and perspectives is necessary to create an intellectual environment that fosters inquiry. It is the responsibility of everyone‚Äîinstructor and students alike‚Äîto share their perspectives and to seek out, listen to, and learn from the perspectives of others. While we may disagree, we must take care that the ideas we express do not deny or subjugate the experiences of others. Such care involves avoiding language that stereotypes or belittles groups.\nIn this class, all students will be treated equitably regardless of race, religion, sexuality, gender identification, gender expression, language background, ability, socioeconomic status, national identity, veteran status, or nontraditional student status. Inclusion means that everyone is welcome here, and that all of us have a responsibility to make others feel welcome; equity means that everyone should have access to the tools they need to be successful. As your instructor, I will do what I can to ensure that you have what you need.\nAs a predominantly white institution (PWI) committed to increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion, we have a special responsibility to study and learn from historically marginalized groups and experiences. Doing so involves becoming sensitive to the ways in which power and privilege have been and continue to be distributed unevenly, depending on one‚Äôs social position. Because power and privilege affect how we write, what we write, and how we are read by others, these issues will be a regular part of class discussion, assigned reading, and writing projects.\nTogether, we‚Äôll establish guidelines for how to respond to each other and to class material respectfully. If you ever feel disrespected or uncomfortable as a result of any exchange related to this class, please share your concerns with your instructor so they can be addressed. Behavior that is deemed harmful to others may result in dismissal from the class and will be reported to the department chair or other appropriate administrators.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/courses/theories-of-cinema/","title":"Theories of Cinema","section":"Courses","content":" Theories of Cinema: Women, Cinema, Nation # üìÇ This syllabus was created and taught by Dr. Alexandra Edwards in Spring 2023 as ENGL 30803: Theories of Cinema. Course Description # ENGL 30803, Theories of Cinema, explores spaces where film and critical theory overlap by juxtaposing key theoretical texts and approaches with films directed by women from around the world. We‚Äôll ask questions like:\nWhat can Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino teach us about the male gaze and the panopticon? Does a documentary about queer black and Latino ballroom culture help us understand why Judith Butler called gender performative? How do gender, race, class, and national identity intersect in horror films? In Oscar-winning dramas? In the brief ethnographic films of Zora Neale Hurston? How have indigenous women filmmakers worked to decolonize the film industry? What do bell hooks and an imaginary movie star have in common? Our class meetings will include discussions, breaks to recharge, and screenings of all required films; students are encouraged to bring their own snacks or meals for a movie bistro-style experience. I take seriously the feminist insistence that we are both our minds and our bodies‚Äîyou can‚Äôt learn when you‚Äôre hungry or exhausted. So even though our class is a long block of time, we‚Äôll mix it up and keep it moving and hopefully have fun digging into the writing and filmmaking work of feminist, queer, decolonial and anti-colonial thinkers.\nMy wildest dream for this course is to recreate the magic of 1970s feminist film festivals, 90s riot grrrl scenes, and the contemporary queer feminist collective Club des Femmes. So I‚Äôve tried to create a class that is less like a stuffy academic space and more like an exciting, generative, and inspiring hangout spot where we watch, think, talk, and write together. We‚Äôll create weekly responses to the course material, film introductions, and a collaborative film zine.\nAssignments and Prompts # Reading and Viewing List Collaborative Zine "}]
