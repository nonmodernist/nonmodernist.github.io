In previous entries, I have marked certain words in bold font to suggest that they are important concepts for us to track. We call these “keywords,” words or short phrases that convey foundational ideas or important topics being addressed.

In this week’s reading, you’ll see some keywords in italics, and you may notice other core concepts related to our previous theory readings (there’s Foucault again!). Make a list of your own keywords for this week.

Open prompt: discuss any aspect of *The Piano* in relation to any aspect of Anne McClintock's "The Lay of the Land."
