Alexandra teaches in the English department at Texas Christian University. Her research focuses on the intersections of literature, film, and other media in the early 20th century, with a special interest in the historical recovery of neglected women writers and filmmakers.

Her first book, [*Before Fanfiction: Recovering the Literary History of American Media Fandom*](https://beforefanfiction.com), was released by LSU Press in October 2023, and recently received an honorable mention for the biennial [MLA Prize for Contingent Faculty and Independent Scholars](https://www.mla.org/Resources/Career/MLA-Grants-and-Awards/Winners-of-MLA-Prizes/Biennial-Prize-and-Award-Winners/MLA-Prize-for-Contingent-Faculty-and-Independent-Scholars-Winners). 

Alexandra‚Äôs current project, [*Hollywood Regionalism*](http://hollywoodregionalism.com), investigates how the studio system adapted, revised, and transformed dozens of regional novels by American women writers from 1910-1961. She and her students have researched hundreds of these film adaptations, many lost or forgotten, and are working to bring them back into public view.

In 2024, Alexandra's photo essay "[A Walk Through Weelaunee Forest](https://www.thexylom.com/post/perspective-a-walk-through-weelaunee-forest)," was a finalist for an Atlanta Press Club Award. The essay explores the natural and political history of the forest slated to become "Cop City" in Dekalb County, Georgia. 

Alexandra previously [co-hosted a podcast about college and coronavirus](https://anchor.fm/residential-spread), wrote a [poetry chapbook about Godzilla](https://nonmodernist.itch.io/call-of-the-monsters), and won two Primetime Emmys for her work as a transmedia producer creating interactive storytelling experiences.
