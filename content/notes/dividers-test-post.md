This is the end of one section.

{{ section_divider() }}

This is the beginning of a new section.

{{ section_divider(style="ornate", symbol="â˜™") }}

You can customize the symbol.

{{ section_divider(style="minimal") }}

Or use a minimal style.

{{ section_divider(style="line") }}

A simple line also works well.
