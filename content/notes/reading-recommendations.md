<span class="og">âž°</span> There's little I love more than a really good sex memoir, especially a [really good sex memoir written by a queer elder](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2024/12/16/a-sex-memoir/): 

> I would do anything, look any way, that would get me laid. I couldn't believe guys years later would advertise themselves by the boot brand or high-tops they wore. In France I remember men saying they were style *santiags* (cowboy boots) or *crade* (unwashed). Wasn't the body or even the personality under the look more important than the accessories? I would wear anything from a red hankie back-left pocket (aggressive penetrator) to yellow back-right (piss swallower), if I thought someone, anyone, would like that. I suppose I believed one's essence was enduring and unshod and of a neutral color and that accessories, so important to the poor and young, were immaterial.

[Jocelyne Saab's filmography](https://mubi.com/en/notebook/posts/life-during-wartime-on-the-films-of-jocelyne-saab) sounds vital for this moment:

> To picture a conflict that violently reconfigured the very fabric of Lebanese society, most visibly in Beirut, Saab broke with established modes of reportage to forge a documentary form that we could describe today as essayistic, which made room for a layered apprehension of the war, its root causes and repercussions.

I'm also buying [***Corpses, Fools, and Monsters: The History and Future of Transness in Cinema***](https://repeaterbooks.com/product/corpses-fools-and-monsters-the-history-and-future-of-transness-in-cinema/) as a holiday treat. I'm particularly interested in how this work might situate transgender representation within broader film history contexts.

*I'll update this note with thoughts once I've dug into these materials more deeply. I'm especially curious about how Saab's documentary approach might inform contemporary conversations about representing complex conflicts.*
