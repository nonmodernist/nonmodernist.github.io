<span class="og">üò†</span> Vengeful ghosts appear across global folk horror traditions, but what distinguishes them within the genre is their deep connection to specific cultural contexts. These spirits typically emerge from local folkloric traditions and often represent historical traumas or unresolved injustices particular to their regions of origin.

## Regional Ghost Traditions in Folk Horror

### Japanese Ghost Traditions

Japanese folk horror features several distinct types of vengeful spirits:
- *Bakeneko: A Vengeful Spirit* (1968, Japan) - The ghost cat tradition where women return as feline spirits to seek revenge
- *Kuroneko* (1968, Japan) - Another ghost cat narrative emphasizing female vengeance
- *Onibaba* (1964, Japan) - While not strictly a ghost story, it draws on demon-woman folklore

Japanese vengeful spirits (*onry≈ç*) typically arise from those who suffered injustice in life, especially women who experienced betrayal or violence.

### Southeast Asian Ghost Traditions

Southeast Asian folk horror draws on rich regional ghost beliefs:
- *The Rites of May* (1976, Philippines)
- *Sundelbolong* (1981, Indonesia)
- *Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam* (2004, Malaysia)

These films often feature female spirits tied to childbirth, maternal grief, or sexual violence.

### European Ghost Traditions

European folk horror incorporates regional ghost folklore:
- *Demon* (2015, Poland) - Drawing on the dybbuk tradition from Jewish folklore
- *Lake of the Dead* (1958, Norway) - Featuring Nordic ghost traditions

### Latin American Ghost Traditions

- *La Llorona* (2019, Guatemala) - Reinterprets the widespread "Weeping Woman" legend through the context of Guatemala's genocide against indigenous peoples

## Common Features

Despite their cultural specificity, vengeful ghosts in folk horror often share certain characteristics:

### Unresolved Trauma

The spirits typically emerge from historical or personal traumas that have not been properly addressed or resolved.

### Cultural Memory

They frequently embody aspects of collective memory or cultural history that mainstream narratives have attempted to suppress or forget.

### Liminal Existence

These ghosts often inhabit liminal spaces - thresholds between worlds, between life and death, between past and present.

### Moral Ambiguity

Unlike in many mainstream horror films, vengeful ghosts in folk horror are frequently portrayed with moral ambiguity - victims as well as threats.

## Political Dimensions

Many contemporary folk horror films use culturally-specific ghost traditions to address political themes:

### Historical Justice

Vengeful ghosts often represent demands for historical justice or recognition of past atrocities.

### Colonial Legacy

In many postcolonial contexts, vengeful spirits embody resistance to colonial narratives and the persistence of indigenous knowledge.

### Gendered Violence

Female vengeful spirits frequently highlight issues of gendered violence and patriarchal oppression.

## Examples of Political Folk Horror Ghosts

*La Llorona* (2019, Guatemala) exemplifies the political potential of the vengeful ghost trope. Director Jayro Bustamante reimagines the traditional Weeping Woman as the spirit of an indigenous woman killed during Guatemala's civil war, haunting a former military general responsible for genocide. The film uses folk horror conventions to address historical trauma and the ongoing struggle for justice.

Similarly, the Thai film *Rang Song* (*The Medium*, 2021) uses traditional beliefs about spirit possession to explore intergenerational trauma and the tensions between traditional practices and modernity in northern Thailand.
