Welcome to my digital (moon) garden - a space where ideas grow and evolve like the phases of the moon. Unlike a traditional blog, these notes develop organically over time.

Here, you'll find a collection of thoughts that may not be fully formed but are in the process of growth. Each note represents a unique phase in its development, much like the moon's journey through the night sky.

Hover over each note to see its current phase.
