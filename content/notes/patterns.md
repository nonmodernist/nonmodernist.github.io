I've been fighting with images on the [teaching](https://nonmodernist.com/teaching/) page of this site (mostly related to sizing and having things look nice yet be responsive), so I decided to replace them with svg patterns generated at [Doodad.dev](http://doodad.dev). Since the Apollo theme used for this site allows me to call any URL as an image on a page with "cards," I was able to replace the images I had been hosting with the URI generated by the "CSS background image" selection on the [pattern generator](https://doodad.dev/pattern-generator/). I don't totally understand the [magic of svg](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Introduction), but that's okay.

The pattern generator itself is fun to play with, and I've been amazed by how a small change to the components can create an entirely new pattern. 

For example, dots in circles become flowers, just by increasing the size of each dot.
