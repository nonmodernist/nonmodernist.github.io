<span class="og">ðŸ’¡</span> There's this idea rattling around in my brain, and I can't figure out how to make it work. Do you know that feeling? It's exceptionally frustrating.

The idea is simple: I want to build a wiki that collects the various *stuff* I use to teach different classes. Things like: the [timeline of optical toys](https://nonmodernist.my.canva.site/optical-toys) that I give my multimedia authoring students, or the [list of folk horror tropes](@/notes/folk-horror-overview.md) that I developed after teaching a genre in film course on the topic.

There are any number of solutions to this problem, but I can't seem to sort out which works best. They all have some kind of friction that prevents me from feeling like, "ah yes, this is right, this works."

Maybe the trouble is that I want to skip ahead to the part where I have pages and pages of material, enough that it feels hefty and substantial. I long for my own [filmsite.org](http://filmsite.org). And I'm certainly not there yet.
