Recently I've been considering launching a dedicated film blog, as an alternative to the [teaching wiki idea](@/notes/2024-12-20-do-you-ever-have-an-idea.md) that I've been mulling over since last year. Two immediate problems arise in my mind: 1) where do I put it? and 2) what do I call it?

Brainstorming possible names got me thinking about my online identities and how I do or don't manage what gets included under their umbrellas. So here are some disorganized thoughts about it.

## What's in a handle?

I changed my primary online handle to "nonmodernist" while I was finishing my masters degree. It was a word I found in an academic book I was reading—unfortunately I will likely never remember which one—that called for an expansion of the study of "nonmodernist" literature of the early 20th century. It struck a chord *(yes! that is what I wanted to do!)* and it has stuck with me as my academic career has progressed and my research agenda has shifted. "nonmodernist" has become not just *what* I want to do, but the actual foundation of my career. I love modernist literature, but it's over-studied, while so much incredible literature and media from the same era hasn't been studied enough (if at all!).

## Whither to blog?

The problem is, the nonmodernist.com domain is currently a catch-all for both my academic and personal identities. So while a "nonmodernist" blog might seem like a logical place to put thoughts on the film and literature I study, it also feels a bit too personal. Too casual. A place where I might type in all lowercase and misuse the word "whither." 

tbh I am probably overthinking all of this and I should just buckle down and start blogging. smh etc etc.
