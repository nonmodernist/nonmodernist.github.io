recently i've been considering launching a dedicated film blog, as an alternative to the [teaching wiki idea](@/notes/2024-12-20-do-you-ever-have-an-idea.md) that i've been mulling over since last year. two immediate problems arise in my mind: 1) where do i put it? and 2) what do i call it?

brainstorming possible names got me thinking about my online identities and how i do or don't manage what gets included under their umbrellas. so here are some disorganized thoughts about it.

## what's in a handle?

i changed my primary online handle to "nonmodernist" while i was finishing my masters degree. it was a word i found in an academic book i was reading—unfortunately i will likely never remember which one—that called for an expansion of the study of "nonmodernist" literature of the early 20th century. it struck a chord (yes! that is what i wanted to do!) and it has stuck with me as my academic career has progressed and my research agenda has shifted. "nonmodernist" has become not just *what* i want to do, but the actual foundation of my career. i love modernist literature, but it's over-studied, while so much incredible literature and media from the same era hasn't been studied enough (if at all!).

## whither to blog?

the problem is, the nonmodernist.com domain is currently a catch-all for both my academic and personal identities. so while a "nonmodernist" blog might seem like a logical place to put thoughts on the film and literature i study, it also feels a bit too personal. too casual. a place where i might type in all lowercase and misuse the word "whither." 

tbh i am probably overthinking all of this and i should just buckle down and start blogging. smh etc etc.
