I finally saw ***Meet Me in St. Louis*** and it was not what I expected. I went through quite a journey while watching it: first I was resistant to the *Little Women*-esque set up, then I was amused by the trolley song, then entertained by Tootie's whole deal, and then before I knew it I was weeping as Judy Garland sang "[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas](https://youtu.be/Tt9L2uWFI4Y?si=-d-RVVwFrtWCpXFS)." Arthur Freed, you absolute genius, why did I ever doubt you.

*Note: This viewing was part of my ongoing exploration of classic Hollywood musicals. Next on my watchlist: more Vincente Minnelli films, particularly his other collaborations with Judy Garland.*
