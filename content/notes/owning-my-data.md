one project i have been working on slowly over the past couple of years is "owning my own data"‚Äîin other words, making sure that i have local & backed up copies of the stuff i post to the internet. it started when i got off goodreads. first i switched to storygraph, and then i decided that i wasn't using any of the site's features, and that i was better off just keeping my [reading log](@/readinglog.md) in a text file. it has lived in my obsidian notes for a long while, but now it also lives here on this website. since i don't finish many books these days, it's easy enough to update the file when i do.[^1] 

i have a .csv of my historical letterboxd data too, but it's going to take me a while to get it into a useful format that can be shared outside their platform. but today while poking around the indieweb, i discovered that letterboxd creates an rss feed of a user's recent activity, which means i can [echo that feed here](@/log/_index.md). i'm using [echofeed](https://echofeed.app) to accomplish this. the service will grab any new movies i log; we'll see how much historical data i end up wanting to add by hand. i am going to guess it will not be the full 1,350 movies in my letterboxd diary. 

also wow i need to fix how footnotes are rendering. 

[^1]: at first i wrote "since i don't read a lot these days," but that's not true. i don't read as much as when i was in grad school, but i do read a lot. it's mostly for work, though, which means it's mostly hunting and gathering for what i need to teach a class or write an essay. i rarely finish a whole book, and i rarely log the dozens of books i one-third read for work reasons.
