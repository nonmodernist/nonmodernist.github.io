# Cults and Extreme Religious Practices

<span class="og">✌︎</span> Isolated religious communities that develop extreme beliefs and practices are a staple of folk horror. These groups typically maintain belief systems that have diverged from mainstream religion, often incorporating elements of paganism, nature worship, or extreme interpretations of established faiths.

## Characteristics of Folk Horror Cults

Folk horror cults typically share several characteristics:

1. **Isolation** - Physical or social separation from mainstream society
2. **Hierarchy** - Clear power structures, often with charismatic leaders
3. **Rituals** - Distinctive ceremonial practices central to their belief system
4. **Sacrifice** - Willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of the community
5. **Secrecy** - Hidden knowledge or practices concealed from outsiders

## Notable Folk Horror Cults

### The Heathen Community of Summerisle

*The Wicker Man* (1972, UK) presents perhaps the most iconic folk horror cult. Led by Lord Summerisle, the inhabitants of this remote Scottish island have revived ancient pagan practices to ensure agricultural fertility.

### The Children of the Corn

In *Children of the Corn* (1984, US), based on Stephen King's story, rural children form a cult that worships "He Who Walks Behind the Rows," sacrificing adults to ensure bountiful corn harvests.

### The Hårga

*Midsommar* (2019, US/Sweden) depicts the Hårga community, whose seemingly benign midsummer celebrations mask disturbing rituals including human sacrifice and eugenics.

## Common Narrative Patterns

### The Infiltration

Many folk horror films follow a structure where outsiders infiltrate or are lured into cult communities:
- *Eye of the Devil* (1966, UK)
- *The Wicker Man* (1972, UK)
- *Apostle* (2018, US)
- *Midsommar* (2019, US)

### The Discovery

Other films feature characters who discover cult activities in seemingly normal communities:
- *Crowhaven Farm* (1970, US)
- *The Dark Secret of Harvest Home* (1978, US)
- *Alison's Birthday* (1981, Australia)

### The Inheritance

Some folk horror narratives involve characters who discover they have inherited a position or role within a cult:
- *Rosemary's Baby* (1968, US)
- *Hereditary* (2018, US)
- *Incantation* (2022, Taiwan)

## Cultural Variations

Folk horror cults reflect the cultural contexts in which they appear:

- **British folk horror** often features neo-pagan revivals in rural communities
- **American folk horror** frequently explores religious extremism and fundamentalism
- **East Asian folk horror** commonly depicts ancestral cults and familial obligations
- **Latin American folk horror** often blends indigenous beliefs with Catholicism

## Sociological Readings

Folk horror cults can be interpreted as expressions of anxiety about:

- **Social conformity** - The pressure to conform to community expectations
- **Modern alienation** - The appeal of belonging to something larger than oneself
- **Cultural tradition** - The tension between preserving tradition and embracing progress
- **Authority** - The dangers of unquestioning obedience to charismatic leaders
