"Tide Pod cinema" is a delightfully bitchy phrase coined by Will Tavlin in his otherwise frustrating essay "Casual Viewing". I think it describes something important about contemporary streaming cinemaâ€”content that appears colorful and attractive but is poisonous to a healthy film culture.

Tavlin uses the phrase to describe Netflix's output of "movies that go down best when you're not paying attention" or films made "to half-watch while doing laundry." The term cleverly captures several qualities of streaming-exclusive films:

1. **Algorithmic Optimization**: Movies that feel designed to satisfy platform metrics instead of artistic vision
   
2. **Disposability**: Content clearly created with no expectation it will be remembered or revisited in a year
   
3. **Superficial Engagement**: Films that prioritize immediate visual appeal over any substantive ideas
   
4. **Formulaic Structures**: Stories so predictable you could write the ending after the first five minutes

## Avoiding Ahistorical Critiques

While I think the "Tide Pod cinema" critique identifies something real, we should avoid nostalgic misconceptions that come with it. Studio-era Hollywood wasn't a golden age where every film was *Casablanca* or *Citizen Kane*. As I pointed out in my [note on the history of film subscription models](@/notes/film-industry-history.md), the ratio of forgettable films to classics has always been high.

Similarly, the notion that theatrical viewing was historically some reverent, distraction-free experience simply isn't true. People talked, ate, entered mid-film, and generally treated movie theaters as social spaces rather than temples of cinematic appreciation. (And that's not even mentioning porn theatres...)

## More Productive Criticism

I think there are more interesting angles to explore when critiquing streaming content:

1. **Creative Control**: How do algorithmic recommendations and data-driven development potentially limit artistic risk-taking?
   
2. **Preservation Issues**: What happens to streaming-exclusive films when platforms decide they're no longer worth hosting?
   
3. **Economic Models**: How does creator compensation in streaming differ from traditional models, and what does that mean for the kinds of stories that get told?

## Questions I'm Still Pondering
    
- How can we develop critical frameworks that acknowledge both continuity and change in media production?

- What do we do with Ethan Mordden's claim that intense demand for product led to creative innovation during the studio system? Could we make the same claim about streaming?

*I'd like to explore these questions further, perhaps in connection with how physical media constraints have historically influenced both film and television production. The transition from physical to digital distribution may be as significant as the shift from stage to screen was in the early 20th century.*
