Please pardon the messâ€”I'm in the process of redesigning this site. Something have been moved over to the new design, but some have not. 

Originally I planned to maintain a Frankenstein version of this site with content from new and old, but setting up the action for Zola to auto-build messed that up. It's entirely possible that I'm not doing git correctly?? But it is what it is at this point. So I'll keep working on porting v1 content over to v2 <span class="og">ðŸ˜µ</span>.
