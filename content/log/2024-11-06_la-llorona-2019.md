i didn't realize when i created my syllabus 6+ months ago that i would be watching this film—about a dementia-riddled former dictator unravelling as his former subjects try to hold him accountable for genocide despite their civic structures being completely ill-equipped to do so—the day after the us election. so that's a thing. can't wait to talk about it with my students.
