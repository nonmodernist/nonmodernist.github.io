reminded me of russian ark a LOT, which is cool because that’s one of my favorite movies. the “ark” here isn’t a palace but a literal ship, and fellini and his crew are doing heroic work with practical effects.

tcm’s print of this film looked like ass though. i wonder if it’s available in better quality in the fellini boxes?
