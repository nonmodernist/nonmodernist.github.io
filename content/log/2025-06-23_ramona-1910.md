an incredibly condensed version of helen hunt jackson's only novel, ramona. this was the first of 4 film versions of the novel, which jackson apparently hoped would do for indigenous rights what uncle tom's cabin did for emancipation. it's sloppy but fascinating—one wonders if griffith and co. knew about jackson's novel before visiting southern california.
