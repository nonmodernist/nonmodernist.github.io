Went in expecting absolute trash. Left genuinely impressed by what might be one of the more thoughtful B-movie erotic thrillers of the '90s.

Yes, this has all the hallmarks of direct-to-video softcore erotica, but beneath the genre trappings is a surprisingly nuanced exploration of sexual trauma that treats its male protagonist's surgical violation with real weight. What could have been exploitative instead runs parallel to the story told by a female member of the trauma support group (about her previous experience of being violently raped), and the film actually lets these traumas resonate and inform the characters rather than just using them as plot devices or for shock value.

Is it capital-C Cinema? No. But it's B-movie craftsmanship that understands its genre while pushing against some of its worst impulses.

Erotic: 8/10 | Thriller: 7/10
