a tremendously bizarre exercise in portraying neo-nazis as cool movie criminals instead of as the dumbfuck idaho hillbillies they were/are. i wish jeremy saulnier had directed this (as i think he originally intended to do), because he at least knows how to convey the sheer disdain needed in a movie like this.
