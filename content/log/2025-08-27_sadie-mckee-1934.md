Based on: "Pretty Sadie McKee" by ViÃ±a Delmar (1933)
Studio: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer

ViÃ±a Delmar wrote this story specifically for Joan Crawford, and it shows in every frame. Crawford is tough but tender as Sadie McKee, the cook's daughter who follows her boyfriend Tommy to New York only to have him desert her hours before their wedding. Broke and heartbroken, she becomes a nightclub dancer, then marries a wealthy alcoholic who falls for herâ€”all while navigating the judgment of her mother's employer's son, who happens to be the millionaire's lawyer.

This is pre-Code Hollywood at its most frank. When Sadie shows her friend Opal around her luxurious new apartment, confirming she doesn't have to sleep with her husband despite their marriage, Opal shrugs: "Some girls do a lot more for a lot less." Released just two months before Production Code enforcement, the film can still acknowledge the sexual economics that underpin its romance plot.

Edward Arnold delivers a heartbreaking performance as Brennan, the good-natured drunk who marries Sadie, nearly dies multiple times, then releases her when she confesses she still loves Tommy. His portrayal of alcoholic devotion is both pathetic and genuinely moving.

The MGM gloss includes stunning technical flourishesâ€”watch for the long takes during the kitchen sequence near the beginningâ€”and a perfect Automat scene that captures 1934 New York.

IN THE DATABASE: Delmar was a Ten-Timer with 13 total adaptations! She specialized in working-girl stories that Hollywood transformed into star vehicles. This magazine serial (never published as a book) became the blueprint for Crawford's career.
