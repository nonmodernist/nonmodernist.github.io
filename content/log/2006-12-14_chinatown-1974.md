One of those movies I fell asleep during in my high school film studies class. Don't blame me, blame the fact that it started at 8 am and I rarely went to bed before 4.

Here are the things of particular interest to me (oh I just love lists):
- wet/dry as a stand in for dark/light in a film shot in color (though some of that dark/light is still there)
- public municipalities conspiracy as thrilling fodder for detective drama
- how Faye Dunaway is gorgeous, and then strangely grotesque within moments of each other (teeth, bare skin, forehead)
- Polanski's interest in (fetish for?) rotting food--see Repulsion
- what it means to lose exactly one shoe
- Jack Nicholson's disarming hotness
- John Huston, in general
